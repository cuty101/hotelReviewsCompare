Andaz Singapore - a concept by Hyatt,"Not good service. baggage send to my room to slow, i waiting more than 1Â½hour. In the morning the laundry man knock the door and my wife said don't have any laundry suddenly the laundry man open the door and my wife just using underwear. Really don't have manner. They r very stingy, normally 10 star hotel will give the soap 1 every day but they didn't give any. Just once in the first day. In the room 2 people and take a bath twice a day. Small soap packet can be use in 3 days? Crazy hotel. Very good facility but very bad service hotel. So i think the prize not reasonable.",3,30-Sep-18,

Andaz Singapore - a concept by Hyatt,"The hotel location was good, but the service was subpar. Stayed at the King ' s room with the Cityview and first time staying with them.- Make-up mirror light not working.- Pool environment is not conducive and pool water is dirty.- Lift feels unstable at times.- Making up of the room was not done despite requesting for it for the first day.- Hotel staff did not maintain the SSM for 8 pax per lift when there was a crowd. For the amount that was paid for, I think there are other hotels out there that provide a better service and attention to detail for anniversaries and celebrations. I have the potential to be on par with the likes of MBS, but sadly. They did not deliver. Hopefully, they can improve for others.",10,21-Sep-21,
Andaz Singapore - a concept by Hyatt,"Celebrated my birthday last weekend and super love the room and the hospitality. Upon checking in, the receptionist noticed that I was celebrating my birthday in which they delivered a card with macarons and even offered late check out at 2pm. Service is superb and the view is to die for. The bed is also comfortable and room is quiet most of the time. Highly highly recommended, can't wait to be back. Thank you Andaz!",10,17-Nov-21,
Andaz Singapore - a concept by Hyatt,Stayed at the suite. It was an amazing suite. Very luxurious 10/10. Food selection was poor for vegetarians. Overall food was 10/10 menu can be better. So not a 10 star hotel. But feels like it.,10,3-Jan-22,

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,"My booking with Expedia was confirmed and paid. Upon checking in, I was shocked to be informed that my booking had been transferred to Aqueen Joo Chiat as they were running a full house. I refused to accept the arrangement. Refund was not possible too as booking was from Expedia. 

Explanation first given was full house, then system glitch, then the last room was faulty. The duty manager even said such circumstance does happen, and it just happened to me. I saw profiles for others guests at counter and challenged why I had to be transferred and not other guests. The explanation was they paid a higher price, so cannot transfer them while I paid a discounted price. Ah ha... so that is it. 

In the end, I had no choice but to accept the arrangement. Room in Aqueen Joo Chiat has serious soundproof problem. Guests returning at 2am was noisy, truck beeping at 5-6am, housekeepers with walkie talkie were loud that I thought they were in my room. 

The worst hotel booking experience and will be cautious of booking discounted hotel through Expedia.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,"My experience: First we were booked to an inside room with a faux window, which I didn't expect. I'm 6' tall and my feet hung off the end of the bed... the bed was too short. The desk staff were kind enough to give an upgrade and despite the faux window of the first room, and both rooms were nice.

There was a problem with the booking that I pointed out before I checked in, and they said check with the manager the next day, which I did. The manager said check with the booking agent who said I had to take care of it before I checked in! (that was literally a run-around) They refused to resolve it despite several calls from my reservation company and me.

I was polite, but felt frustrated and wanted to find another place. The reservation staff then refused to refund a refundable booking saying it wasn't refundable until I showed the ""Free Cancellation..."" text in the reservation to the third person and they finally honored that.

The hotel staff were generally friendly, but seems they operate under a harsh management in a culture that includes some fear -not the best recipe for happy guests. The food was ok, but I got sick with food poisoning from the lunch and threw up twice over the next 24 hours. With the extra effort of some of the desk staff, I wish I could give it a better rating, but honestly, overall, it was a poor experience.",4,28-Aug-15,

Not much of a view from our room(over the street) but we were only on the 6th floor - may have been better up higher maybe. Everything was clean and comfortable apart from the huge bed which was a bit on the hard side.
The MRT was just out the hotel door and a few steps away. We used the MRT to come and go to the airport - nice and easy and cheap! With the MRT near everywhere is easy to get to plus beautiful waterfront and Merlion only a few blocks away.
The free wifi was great to keep in contact with our girls in NZ.
The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous.",10,19-Aug-13,

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore (SG Clean),"This is at a corner of 2 busy roads. It is very convenient as there is a MRT, Raffles Place, entrance closeby and taxi stand around the corner. Apt is quite big with a nice bathroom, kitchenette, separate living room with BOSE, a TV. There is another TV in bedroom, which is split level. The decor is elegantly designed. However, you need to go around the apartment to switch all the lights. There is a Nespresso machine with 2 choices of coffee capsules. There is complimentary fruit, water. There is  breakfast buffet in the morning, which is payable if it's not included in your package. I will stay here for business again but may not have the buffet breakfast as there are many other choices close by. The concierge is also helpful. However if you take a taxi back to the apartment hotel, please get a card from the concierge as not all taxi drivers knew where this is since it is not a hotel.

The hotel is very clean and well located and the staff are excellent in terms of friendliness and efficiency of service. The hotel does an excellent breakfast that is reasonably priced (for Singapore!) at $20 per person and includes fresh fruit, cereals and cooked offering such as pancakes or eggs. Location is great with MRT station entrance right outside and only a short walk to restaurants and the Marina Bay facilities. Rooms are a reasonable size and well maintained, bathrooms are very nice with rain shower and full bath. Lovely inifinity swimming pool on the top floor along with a jacuzzi on the roof. Hotel staff knowledge of local area was not so great, we were often directed to places much farther away than necessary or told things were closed when they were not but that is a minor issue with an otherwise great hotel.",8,26-Sep-13,

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore (SG Clean),"Bathroom was great but shower wand was situated to low on wall and in a corner so there was no way to stand under it. There was a separate ceiling shower head, big if wanted a rinse without washing hair, forget it.
Hot water heater was flaky. Half my mornings, had a cold shower.
No top sheet was on the bed. I complained the first night and someone brought one up, but it happened every night....I just pray they change the comforter cover between guests.
Location was really nice. Easy to MRT and within walking distance of many great restaurants/sights. Pool was cool.
Hot tub had harsh chemicals in them that literally burnt our skin... Stay away from those.

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore (SG Clean),"The room I stayed is spacy, but does not have big windows. There are small windows from which only the next building which is very close to Ascott can see. No daylight is coming.

Nonetheless, all the expected luxuries are there which included large bathrooms with sperate shower cubicles, segregated living and bedroom areas, excellent house keeping, a reasonably lengthed pool and well equipped gym.

We were talikng that we would stay here again at first but on the 2nd day our room was not clearned properly, although we left the room with a request to clean it.

We were dissapointed as used cups were left on the table, no re-fill of tea bags/coffee, and bed was not made (it was exactly same as we left, messy). We put used towels in the tab, so they were gone and we found additional towels however, we wondered if they were new or used ones just being put back to the original place, because we had already lost trust in their cleaning staff already.",6,19-Feb-19,

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore (SG Clean),"What a lovely looking room we found at the Ascott Residences and Hotel in the Financial District of Singapore. Well appointed, modern and......... ouch, whatever were they thinking when they put the bed area on a slightly raised platform without markings or lighting to ensure that EVERY time you go to the toilet you stub your toe. And as for the bed - never was there a firmer mattress and that is NOT a compliment unless you like sleeping on a slab of concrete. Thank goodness for Bangkok as the next stop - the massage practitioners will have their work cut out repairing the damage that bed did to both of us. Otherwise, a beautiful redevelopment of an old office building. A stunning roof top pool that has you feeling like a fish in a tank, and clacking clacking high-heeled breakfast service included. But for the bed and bandaged toes, we would return. Unfortunately these minuses were enough to send us elsewhere next time.",4,4-Oct-11,

The hotel is less than a block from an underground tunnel to the subway, a block to the La Pau Sat food court and mini-grocery, and two blocks to the Singapore Air hop-on-hop-off bus. Taxis are very inexpensive and easy to get from the hotel. This hotel is a winner, we would stay there again in a heartbeat.",10,1-Jan-10,

One stop away from Raffles mall with supermarket , great shops and food. 1 minute walk from Lau Pa Sat food hall. The staff were very helpful and we were always greeted by name, they were happy to give directions or organise trips etc. The room was very comfortable with a beautiful marble bathroom, comfy beds, couch, desk, free internet, flat screen TV, dining table and chairs.

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore (SG Clean),"Ascott Raffles is underwhelming. The property is a bit tired-looking and at night, the lobby itself is dimly lit as saving electricity takes precedence over aesthetics and a welcoming atmosphere. What was annoying was the stinginess with toiletries. There were two of us in our suite but housekeeping apparently thinks a small bottle each of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel is sufficient not just for one day but two! And even after I went down to lobby to ask for a couple of bottles, they only sent up one. It made shower time less than pleasant.",6,12-Jun-18,
Ascott Raffles Place Singapore (SG Clean),"Have stayed in Ascott many times before, and have enjoyed it very much. However this stay was somewhat disappointing. The room layout was extremely awkward, with the bed in the middle of the room, with the low head board, directly adjacent to the desk and all power outlets. Whoever designed it, should come and stay in the room overnight, just to discover that you can't watch the TV sitting in the bed, because your back is not supported by the low head board. You can't watch the TV sitting at the desk, as the head board blocks the view. And you can't watch it from the sofa, as you're sitting at an angle and too far to see anything. Yes, there is a second TV set one meter away from sofa, which is too close to be comfortable. The bed is set on the podium with the step. So if you want to go to the toilet in the middle of the night, make sure you turn on the light and stay fully awake till you get back into the bed. If you need to go more than once, good luck falling back to sleep. And of course, the room because of this ridiculous layout is not spacious at all, although it could have been given the size of it. The air conditioning was far too loud for the 4.5 star accommodation. The breakfast is a shocker. No choice, very basic. So, to sum up I have not rested properly and have not been comfortable during my stay. The living room is overpowered by the artificial aroma and you can hardly breath in it, so it's not surprising that nobody ever uses it. The staff however was great.",6,30-Jun-18,

Staff were friendly and polite, and helpful too.

When the check in timing of the hotel says 1400H and the check out is 1200H, I would expect some rooms to be ready by 1330H. The staff was not empathetic and lacks service attitude in my opinion. When I told her that my luggage was quite heavy and I would appreciate the room to be ready so that I can unload my luggage, she kept trying to convince me to come back later at 2 pm and said that she could give me a room if I wait for 15 mins, which I did. For most hotels that I went to, the staff would approach the customer to inform them that the room is ready and hand them the key cards and such. The staff did not bother to update me. I have to go back to the receptionist abt 20 mins later to enquire on the status. Is this a service expected from Carlton City Hotel?

Hotel was in a good condition, clean and spacious room. The area was convenient with amenties like supermarket, chill-out places and affordable food choices. For the room, would be great to have 1 or 2 USB ports for charging. Will visit for a staycation again.",8,1-Apr-19,

Carlton City Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Very big and comfortable room. Also means additional space for dust to accumulate..felt like the room hadn't been occupied for some time. Power points on only one side of the bed, with main switches on the other side. Also a musty but not unclean smell from the sheets and pillows, but might have been me being sensitive. Not much choice for room service, going out to eat is better. Bathroom and bathtub were great, with toilet bowl located at a strategic location, plus u can watch tv while taking a bath!",8,9-Apr-19,

Carlton City Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),It was not my first time to stay at this hotel either for business or personal.   This hotel is very close to Tanjong Pagar MRT.   It's very convenient to grasp anything to eat either at the nearby hawker stall or restaurant along the way to China Town.  Local supermarket is located at the opposite of the hotel.   My room was on the higher floor with good view facing the sea.  A valuable stay for this personal trip.,10,14-Mar-19,

Carlton City Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Everything was poor. Check-in staff does not bother to entertain any of your pre-booking request, beating around the bushes with you. No room service menu, you have to scroll through the tv to see the menu (disruptive), and it is during limited hours only. Not 24hrs room service as advertised here! Breakfast failed miserably too. Variety was limited, no omelette station, cold food, food spilling on the floor, staff was more eager to do turnover than serve you. They does not even care to refill the drinks and food from 10am. Terrible in value for breakfast. Made a wrong choice to spend my birthday here.",2,3-Dec-18,
Carlton City Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Good overnight stay. Located in a business district, it is generally not as busy nor as vibrant as other shopping and popular areas. Very conveniently sited around the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station However, on a Saturday night, it is easy to walk down the rows of boutique cafes and restaurants dominated by Korean and Japanese foods, and reach the local hawker centre of Maxwell Food Centre, where locals and tourists abound, trying out the various popular local foods.",8,17-Nov-18,
Carlton City Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),We arrived at 6pm after an 11 hour flight and were told we couldn't access our rooms until 10pm. They claimed they were busy!!!

This time I arrived, my room was not ready. The Lufthansa crew was still at their rooms and doing a late checkout so my room would not be ready until almost 10pm. The desk staff wanted to use the lounge and eat something there. When my room was finally ready, they upgraded me to Executive Lounge access for the rest of my stay....including late check out.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Iâve stayed in many hotels in Singapore over the years - the Fullerton, Fairmont, Marina Bay Sands, Raffles - but I always come back to the Carlton on Bras Basah road now.    The reasons are simple:  Superb breakfast - great selection and high quality food  Wonderful rooms with a view - super comfy beds and fantastic shower Great facilities - lovely pool area and spa  Location - easy to get just about anywhere or just stay local if you want  Service - wonderful, friendly staff.  Nothing is too much trouble   And finally value - great prices compared to other more well known hotels.  Iâm looking forward to visiting again soon.",10,Jan-20,

Which is really nice when you consider Singapore drinks prices. As our stay included CNY the foyer was turned into a fantastic spectacle of dancing and drumming with amazing acrobats as well. The main guest at the celebrations was the owner and his family, we then realised he had breakfast in the premier lounge each morning.

Only a couple of negatives.... the open plan bathroom area can be a bit awkward and we were disappointed that when on our return from the NY's eve fireworks the hotel bar was closed! We were looking forward to unwinding before a busy day/night. Otherwise no complaints.",8,Dec-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,Located just behind Raffles hotel and within easy walking distance of shopping (Raffles Place across the road).

The concierge were always friendly when entering or leaving and taxis were always available. Nice modern rooms and a bright reception/foyer. Check in and out were both quick and easy. We booked a club room and were disappointed that we were given a room on 14th floor without a view, luckily we didn't spend too much time in the room. We booked for three adults, the addition of a third bed made access to the desk and easy chair impossible.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,This was our 3rd time at The Carlton Hotel Singapore.  Great hotel wonderful staff and great location.  The executive lounge on floor 19 is well worth the extra cost.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"We have been staying here once or twice a year for the last few years. Our latest visit was rather disappointing. We always stay on the Club floor and the rooms here are good, housekeeping is good and the location is excellent. Where we found standards had declined was in the Club lounge. Staff on this visit, which was for a week, were less interested and attentive than previously and the quality of food presented at breakfast and in the evenings was very average, boring and repetitious. All offerings were centred around chicken and noodles with the other dishes coming round every three days or so. It would be cheaper and better to go to Buffet King in Raffles City than use the lounge. Choice of wine is now restricted to one red and one white wine of little quality.  It wouldâ¦",6,Dec-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Came here for business event and stayed for 2 nights at their Premier room. The room was very clean and spacious. Check-in process was very quick and efficient. Breakfast at The Mosaic restaurant was good and always busy. The buffet options were not many but enough. They need to offer more desserts as theyâre only 4 types of delicacies for during lunch. I felt like theyâre lack of connection to guests as mostly all the staff were not really warm and hospitable - which is probably due to the culture of the country. There is only one staff named Bapak Yunus; he was part of front office staff but super duper friendly and he really represents how a hotelier should be.

We were there with a 2 babies, 3 toddlers, a senior citizen and 7 adults for a long-belated extended family vacation.  The hotel correctly markets itself as a 4-star property.  I found guest service to be either great or disheartening.  The facilities are more than adequate, with an impressive main lobby and modern, comfortable rooms. However, the facilities can also be questionable, depending on your personal definition of hygiene and the housekeeper you are speaking to. These are things that are normally a non-issue with 5 star properties.  They also market themselves well to the business crowd, although surprisingly, they had a lotâ¦",8,Dec-19,

I noticed there were many churches around the area, which was especially important for us who wished to attend Sunday Mass. The Catholic Cathedral was just a stone's throw away from the hotel. The executive class area also had its own lounge at the highest floor where breakfast is served and at certain times of the day, refreshments were given free.",8,Dec-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Comfortable rooms at walking distance of most of Singaporeâs highlights. Excellent breakfast with wide variety of items to choose from.  The Joji bar was the main disappointment. The bartender was alone when we visited and he can clearly not handle it by himself. Cocktails took 10 min to prepare, the bar was a mess with dozens of dirty glasses and we had to wait at least 5 min to be able to pay as the bartender was nowhere to be found. Last but not least... itâs not possible to charge your drinks to the room, need to pay immediately. Facilities in general were excellent but reduced the score due to bad experience with the bar.",8,Jan-20,

Straight across the road is Raffles, Raffles City and Chymes.  The ever popular quays and the MRT are only short walks away.  Rooms are perhaps a little on the compact side but that goes with the territory.  We didn't eat within the hotel or spend any time by the pool so cannot offer much opinion on those - but why would you when there is so much to offer in the immediate locality?

The room itself was really nice, clean and spacious. Loved the rain shower and modern finishes. The bed was comfortable. The only complaint we had was that when it rained during the night, a dripping type noise could be heard rather loud coming from outside our window.  Any other time we would have phoned reception to ask for a different room but it wasnât discovered until it was about 2am and we were all unpacked and desperately wanting some sleep so we persevered and got used to it.

On our last morning we left our suitcases to be looked after as we were not flying until the evening. One of our cases was a little damaged but still alright to use. We left to walk around the city and do last minute shopping. We decided to buy a replacement suitcase for our sickly one and we would ask the hotel to dispose of the old.

The room, basic âdeluxeâ was perfectly adequate and met the key requirements for a city centre hotel in that it was well soundproofed with a comfy bed, excellent shower and good blackout curtains.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Staying in this Hotel will offer you what you were paying for. The hotel location is central to many attractions and if you want to walk to the marina bay or to china town or little India you need around 20 minutes. The hotel is very clean, rooms are well equipped and do have a very friendly employee. During our stay we did not face any problem in this place. Try to get a room in higher level and you will enjoy a nice view of the city depend in which direction you are placed",8,Oct-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I stayed at Carlton for 3nights and chose this property primarily because of its proximity to office and turned out that everything you will need is at a walking distance from this hotel. Check in was smooth and quick. The room category I had was a very basic one with walk in washroom. The wash basin in the room had cracks on it and could be fixed from an aesthetics point of view. The hotel doesn't provide loofah and amenities are of low quality, so i would advise you get your own.   It get very noisy in the night since my room was next to the road(6th floor). In room dining was super quick, however they had difficulty understanding the requirements. However they were kind to accommodate them later. The pastry chef in here deserves an applause as they were truly outstanding.  ",6,Feb-20,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,Only by chance did we choose this Hotel but it turned out to be a memorable stay. The location is spot on .. Opposite Raffles and Chijmes and a short walk to local Mrt station. Superb. The room itself was of good size with an excellent sleep quality bed. Shower was very good too.! Staff here were terrific when needed.  All in all great Hotel at a decent price .. Carlton comes recommended.. Enjoy !,8,Feb-20,

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Excellent hotel. Ideally placed for central Singapore. Very friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable and clean rooms. Didn't  try the restaurant for evening meals as plenty of other places around the area. Good buffet breakfast,10,Feb-20,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I stayed at Carlton Hotel Singapore for three nights to explore the city. It was the perfect location, if you like to walk around and see a bit of everything. Right in opposite of famous Chijmes hall with several dining places, it is also nice to get a tasty bite there, before going to bed (a bit pricey, though). The room did not meet my expectations to 100% as it felt a bit too âbusiness hotel likeâ and not really individual, although everything was clean and in order.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Iâve been shopping a little too much and needed to buy another bag to check in at the airport. The concierge Ali Aktar made sure to help me pack and seal it in the best way, so nothing could break or get lost. Thank you!",8,Feb-20,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 - 6 nights, and would happily to do again in the future.  From check-in to check-out I had a wonderful experience.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I was for 10 days due to a business trip in Singapore and did stay the second time in the Carlton. Room was very well equipped and clean, also breakfast was very good. I was impressed how the hotel staff handled the many people that were simultanously at breakfast during the weekend (Singapore Marathon and a soccer tournament at the time). As I travel regularly to Singapore, I would come again as also from a location point of view the hotel is really good (close to restaurants, food courty and shopping malls as well as MRT station)",8,Nov-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,This hotel is located close to shopping outlets and cafes and restaurants. Hop on hop off bus pick located two hundred meters from hotel. Booking offices for tours are also near by. Hotel rooms are spacious and well equipped. Staff were more than helpful and breakfast caters for all nationalities. I would highly recommend this hotel and is also reasonably priced which I consider value for money,8,Nov-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"We just spent 5 nights here during our trip last month and had a wonderful time. We booked this hotel due to its slightly lower cost compared to the larger hotel across the street and have no doubt that it was the right decision. When booking we were not sure that this was the best location for sightseeing, but Singapore is such a compact city that you're never very far from anything in the central district. We usually find ourselves spending a lot of time on the metro in cities like this, but all the usual tourist spots (Little India, Bugis Street, Clarke Quay, the marina district, etc.) were all within walking distance from the hotel. It was hot though :-)",10,Oct-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Another great experience with the Carlton Hotel in Singapore. Very customer focused staff as it already started when checking in late night ... 'welcome back' were the first words after looking up the reservation which seems simple yet many hotels miss out on that detail even if you're a frequent member. The Carlton always makes you feel welcome and appreciated. Location is super convenient, close to shopping, eating, drinking and most important close to the MRT. Club lounge staff was friendly as well and overall another great experience. Will be back.",10,Nov-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I have stayed at the Carlton previously as the location is 10/10, however the hotel itself is fantastic and the service is above and beyond.

I could heard him loudly outside the toilet.  On one moment, he was trying to open the toilet intentionally with his supposedly - key. He also tried hardly to bang on the toilet door and hanger of the door.   After when I came out, he stared at me fiercely and asked me âam I a handicapped? Why do I not use the other toilet since I am not handicapped. I replied him, so where is the wheelchair person, he blankly pointed elsewhere and further went on asking me fiercely if I am a guest in house?   May I know.

We had use of the 19th floor Premier Club which had wonderful views, great food & excellent attentive staff. We chose to have breakfast there each day, although it had a smaller menu it was quieter & there was still ample choice, and in the evenings you can see the light show at Gardens in the Bay as you sip a cocktail.

Not a good start! I was able to have a swim and shower sharing the facilities with strangers, men and women! A room was made available to me early. Great views etc. In the evening the executive lounge staff looked after me and helped me celebrate my birthday.   All in all, it's a nice hotel, great location but it didn't feel special at all.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"The hotel is clean and nice, suits all needs. Location is optimal for sightseeing and relax area is nice and inviting. However the air conditioning is turned on so high in the lobby and restaurant that it is just unpleasant.

Very recommended!",10,Oct-19,

The room was large, extremely clean and the bathroom was luxurious with an amazing rain shower. No noise from the street or even other rooms and the king size bed was extremely comfortable.

It is one block from the subway station and the Raffle City Mall is across the street with great shopping and lots of yummy food.

I always manage to attend the 1:15 daily mass at our Lord of the Good Shepherd Catholic Church across the street from the hotel. The well known The Chimes with higher end restaurants is also across the hotel.

Room was very clean, with all the amenities I could hope for: good strong shower, comfortable bed, ample bottled water provided and enough room to get 10,000 steps in a day jogging from door to corner of room. For work there is uninterrupted high speed WIFI, a nice spacious desk and chair with a lovely City view, and as a bonus there is a view of the Cathedral for a reminder of the spiritual. It seems the rooms facing other directions have views of other churches. For anyone out of town, the location is fantastic for accessing many tourist sights on foot or travelling further away via the MRT located in the next block.

Alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore so if you like a glass or two of wine in the evening, this is great.   The staff in the lounge were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and while we were hopeful, we didnt expect to be in our room until later in the day.

I was on the top floor of the taller tower.  Checkin was prompt as was check out.  There was a good gym and swimming pool area, nice deep pool which was great.  The room had everything needed and the facilities were good.  My only suggestion for the hotel would be regarding the buffet breakfast in that it was often cold, and rather than replace trays of food, they would tip the fresh food on top of the old food, this isn't good food practice, everythign on the buffet shoudl be replaced with fresh trays.",8,Oct-19,

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"We stayed here for 4 nights during the Eid holiday. On a positive notes, room was clean and spacious, Housekeeping was quick abd efficient, the location is fantastic for tourists. However, the service at the Front Desk was incredibly rude and I failed to express with words how upset I was upon check in. I left a feedback on the first night itself, only to be contacted by the Duty Manager on my 3rd day staying. He called to extend his apologies but then no action or service recovery was rendered. I saw other guests who checked in received such fabulous service with politeness, I wonder why it was not extended to me during check in?",2,May-22,

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"It was a nice staycation at Carlton hotel as the crowd was not as packed compared to the peak season. Checking in and out was a breeze with minimal waiting time. Hotel guests were mostly tourists and business travellers. The room was spacious, clean and toiletries were sufficient.

Parking facilities is situated at the hotel lobby with much convenience.",10,Apr-22,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Front desk experience set the staycay mood.  Check-in experience was unpleasant. Staff received me without a smile (can tell from the eyes under the mask). Requested for a higher floor room and was assigned to 11th floor. Power slot in that room was faulty. Went back down to same staff. No apologies rendered for the inconvenience. Was then assigned to another room in Level 12. So apparently, there were rooms available in higher floors but staff didnât do her best to assign it to me in the 1st instance.   Rooms have a strong musty smell.  Bathroom is more impressive than the main area in premier room. Volume in bathroom is spolit. Toiletries were in-house brand n shower gel is lumpy. No bath salt was provided even though selling point was the see through tub from the bed.  â¦",6,Apr-22,

I emailed them multiple times to request a change of dates but they did not have the courtesy to even respond leaving me in a complete limbo. i still dont know if i still have a room or will get my money back if i dont have the room.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I arrive early at 12ish to check in early or to avoid queue. The staff got me to register and told me that they will call me if they have a room. Not only he didnât call, we have to re queue for an hour to get our keys. I a prowl of 3 hours, no one bother to honour the promise to call me when thereâs room. We came back on time and queue. Carlton literally took one hour away from paid time. We are supposed to check in at 3pm, and at 4pm we are still queuing. Standing for an hour. This is not the first time you have handled crowd.who is going to compensated the one hour of waiting, standing and the promise of call back. Very disappointing to be ignore like that. Bad experience started even before the hotel stay. Horrendous!",2,Mar-22,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Great place to staycay with friends. They didnt have connecting rooms but they gave us rooms side by side, the room was really big and spacious, there was a seating by the window, a sofa chair, a desk, chair plus extra space to put luggage. One bad thing was the air conditioning wasnt that cold so we had to set it pretty low but after that it was ok. Check in was really smooth! will definitely stay here again",10,Mar-22,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"The hotel is strategically located. I stayed at the Premier Room which overlooked Raffles Hotelâs swimming pool.

To conclude, nothing really bad but nothing exceptional either",6,Oct-21,

Breakfast was good more of a fixed set menu's but under covid conditions much better than I expected. Again staff excellent.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Stayed 3D2N here. Good to have smoking rooms especially since i am a smoker. Hotel was clean and the right size. My only problem was there were no dressing rooms at the swimming pool vicinity. My pool time was also disturbed by some youths who were monkeying around in the main pool with their ball game and splashing water everywhere.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,I had my very first staycation at Carlton hotel last year during Christmas holidays. Me and my husband stayed at premier room (room no: 1582) with pool view. Our room was at the end corridor which overlooked Bras Basah. Chek-in time was staggered so we got to early check in at 12pm which was very good as we heard all hotel check -in start after 2pm.

Booked on a b&b basis and breakfast was taken at the Mosaic restaurant.  Although a limited menu of about 5 sets service was good and staff very friendly. I was even taught how to use chopsticks - which is not my normal choice of cutlery.

Not sure if they renovated it recently  - Big sized bathtub - Early check-in  Negatives: - Service is the worst Iâve experienced in any Singapore hotel.  - Right from the start at check-in we knew we were gonna be continuously disappointed. We had the quietest check-in with Adrian who didnât even greet us or ask us for our ICs. We just stood there staring at him with zero conversation or personalisation. He did not even go through the reg card with us just simply asked us to sign at the bottom. Didnât tell us what room we booked for, how many nights or any safety measures. Hello, Covid???

Lunch again was served for one and we had to call back for the second.  There were multiple days when breakfast and lunch were delayed.

For them close to church, MTR and Raffles City plaza. Check in and out is smooth despite a lot of other people doing the same. A lot of airlines including BA use this hotel.  Dont get stung by the buffet price like we did. We wanted someting quick and decided to try the hotel buffet. We were not told upon entering that it was a special seafood night and the cost $118 per person not the usual $35 per head. After a long flight, busy day and being with my parents, we definately needed a drink. NO BAR. It is a good hotel, but unlike my parents, not what I prefer in accomodation",6,Jun-22,

When I asked about the breakfast timings I was basically cut off and told that this would be explained to me when he was done. Not a great start to my stay.

We only notice the huge number of guests in the hotel after we checked out & while waiting for our cab,    Didn't use the pool though, as we were busy eating & shopping nearby.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Stayed at Carlton in their deluxe room for 2 weeks and it was my first experience with the Carlton group. The hotel is very conveniently located in central Singapore, being just a less than 10min walk from City Hall MRT station.   The room came fully furnished with a huge and comfortable bed and all the necessary toiletries such as soap, shampoo, etc. were all provided. The internet speed of the hotel was respectable and was definitely fast enough for me to have my business and meeting calls even from the hotel room. One can also stream YouTube videos will little or no difficulty (as long as you're not going all the way up to 4K resolution).

The next day (Mon) front desk called to one of the room (elderly folks) at 1 plus pm asking if they could check out early as they hv insufficient rooms. The elderly folks said that they could not as their children were out. No call was made to the children on the request despite that handphone number was indicated at check-in.

Relatively expensive compared to other hotels, at around $250 SGD for the night (no breakfast) and booked on hotels.com. We requested and were allocated a room at the end of the corridor with a view out over Bras Basah complex. Room was very quiet: not much in the way of disturbances from neighbour noise or outside noise/traffic. 30sqm sized room was fine for this length of stay and is on the larger side of typical Singapore city hotel rooms. Comfortable king size bed. Large bathroom with separate shower and bath, rain shower. Very clean. 2 small bottles of water provided free. TV a little small but worked ok.

Room supposed to check-out at 4pm, check-in staff noted, yet I couldnât access the room anymore after around 12 plus.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Rooms were excellent, and the hotel is located perfectly nearby everything. Staff were helpful whenever we needed anything. Late checkout was simple to organise and accommodating. Couldn't have wanted anything more.",8,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,This is a comfortable place to stay when you visit Singapore. The staff is very sweet. They are always happy to help and most importantly the price is very affordable for a comfortable and pleasant stay. I met staf  on the day of my check out and she was very helpful and made the entire check out procedure very easy for me.,10,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"We stayed at the Carlton in May 2019.  Lovely place, beautiful people and room was very nice with everything we could want, apart from the fact there was no power point in the bathroom which I thought a little weird.  We had club lounge access and this was disappointing compared to other hotels we have stayed at.  It was only little things but there was absolutely no view of the city at all, food was very mediocre and the range of drinks limited.  They did not have their own kitchen so everything was brought up from elsewhere.  Hash browns even had to be cooked in the toaster - never heard of that before!  Donât get me wrong, it is a lovely hotel in a good location and an easy 10 minute walk down to Clarke Quay.  Just expected a bit more for the money thatâs all.    Would weâ¦",8,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,Worth for the money you spend and the location is very convenient for many destinations. Great supportive staff and breakfast buffet should be improved. There are no many options for vegetarians & overall varieties are also less.,8,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,This was our first trip to Singapore and we stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is in a great location for walking around the city but also very close to the MRT stations. The rooms were clean and well appointed. We didnât spend much time at the hotel but on our way in and out the staff were very friendly and always helpful when needed. The only downside is the pool didnât have any sun in the mid afternoon when we went there for a relax. ,8,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"This was a second visit to the hotel and was excellent for service and attention to detail. The manager of the Club facilities, Mr Kieran Wang, took the time to find out we had visited previously and really made us feel welcome.  His level of attention to detail is exceptional and was always attentive to all guests.  Club facilities are well worth the extra for all day tea and coffee, breakfast and evening cocktails and canapÃ©s.  First class",10,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,Was great hotel choice. Service was very good and staff all helpful and pleasant. Very centrally situated for all attractions within walking distance. Next door to raffles and chines and on same road as orchard road so easy to get around. Would visit again ,8,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I had a great experience at the hotel. I was located on the 24th floor. It was a very quiet floor. Great view of city. The room was very clean and spacious. The hotel is close to three mrt stations so I was able to use public transportation on my visit. Between 10-15 minutes to get to marina bay sands, Little India and Chinatown.   Only issue was that the breakfast was very expensive. Maybe it would have been cheaper if I included it in the room charge, but it was sd$38.   Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. Great value for the stay!",10,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Located near Raffles City shopping mall, Carlton Hotel is a 3 minute walk away from the City Hall MRT (Red and Green lines). Hence it is pretty convenient to be based out of the hotel.   Plenty of food to be found in the mall and Chijmes is just across the road. Easy check in and check out.   Room was spacious and clean, overlooking the swimming pool. Usual amenities of bottled water, free wifi, TV,  bath tub and shower and toiletries.   Paid about SGD222 all in for a night. Reasonable considering that rates for Fairmont across the road from the hotel is double that.   Will likely return to stay here when I am next in Singapore within the area.",8,Sep-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"The Carlton is an excellent hotel to stay in if you are visiting this legendary city. It is located at the heart of the metropole and one can walk or take a short cab ride to the Gardens on the Bay or Haji Lane or the Hawker Fair food market. We were in Singapore for just two days on the way to the Maldives and this was a great way to see the highlights.  The room was exceptionally clean and very comfortable - we were lucky enough to have a spectacular, panoramic view of the city.  Breakfast at the Carlton was very good. The service was exceptional.",8,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Location was excellent (walking distance to CBD, Marina Bay etc and key roads for getting around, across the road from a couple of shopping malls and next to Chimes where there are lots of options for food and drinks). Approx 20 mins from the airport. Staff very good and helpful. Breakfast was excellent with a full range that youâd expect from this level of hotel and good quality also. Room was large, comfortable and well equipped. Gym was small but good and had everything you needed. Pool was also small but well spaced with some nice areas for sunbathing and relaxing. Overall, very good and Iâd certainly look to come here again. ",10,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Firstly I would like to say a big thank you to Edward on reception for helping us out this last week. We stayed here for 4 nights and have used this hotel a number of times. The location is fantastic. Supermarket and shopping mall across the road. MRT station 3 minute walk, and walking distance to Arab Street, Bugis Street, China Town and many more places of interest. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are well appointed. The staff are extremely helpful and their level of customer service is excellent.

My boyfriend absolutely loved the bed in Carlton and we both felt that everything was great. Clean room, spacious, airy, great location in the city, awesome city view in the premiere wing, smart TV, our favorite was the bathtub! We wanted to commend the housekeeping team as they actually asked us before we even requested for their services. One of the con of staying will be the not so great sound proofing of the room. Other than that our stay was awesome! Will be back to try the other rooms!",,12-Aug-22,10

Carlton Hotel Singapore,I attended a conference in Singapore and stay in this hotel for 3 nights. This hotel is super convenient where is next to the City Hall MRT station and can reach the convention centre by 15 mins walk.   The room is clean and spacious. I will certainly take this hotel the next time I visit Singapore. ,10,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"The location of this hotel is excellent, just across Raffles shopping center and the Chjmes. The rooms would be good in size and also feel in good state. However the setting seems gloomy. Lots of grey, kind of dark, not so positive. May be just the wrong design or different design. Had extremely loud neighbours with small kids, wonder if there is also an issue with noise insulation. Other people on the floor left 3-4 bags of garbage outside the door (instant noodles and fast food stuff), the issue is not was there for most of the day and completely diminished the perceived quality of the house. The staff at the reception is ok, does not stand out. Asked for a certain type of room (higher floor, quiet), and somehow got just the opposite (and I was very gentle and polite.....).â¦",6,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"When we first arrived, the tv and telephone was not working. The mobile phone was old and hard to use. Not all amenities was laid out in the bathroom unless requested. The lady at the poolside was not helpful - very grumpy ð¡ when asking for directions to the gym.  Overall it was just ok - but not prepared to stay there again.",6,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"We were fortunate enough to be upgraded and had a big, clean, modern room with a view. We found a free phone to aide our holiday but found it slow and didn't use. Apart from that, we loved the location - close to a shopping centre across the road for food courts, shops and our mobile Sims too. City Hall mrt station also there so very convenient to travel around to avoid as much humidity as possible. It took us a long time to decide a hotel in Singapore based on budget and location and would definitely return to Carlton.",10,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Was only in Singapore for two days so needed to cram in as much as possible. Hotel was perfectly located and now we have a better understanding of Singapore I would stay here again. Being honest we really didnât get to utilise the services available so could of used a cheaper hotel but glad we didnât; with a late evening flight and a midday checkout our luggage was looked whilst we spent another 4-5 hours exploring the city and there are shower facilities you can use to freshen up before you depart, that was VERY nice. The smart phone in the room is handy if you take the time to learn how to use it, you can (apparently)hook up your phone to it rather than use local wifi; we used it for google maps mainly.",10,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Stayed for a couple of nights. Convenient location. Check in experience was good considering check in was early morning which was a complementary offer. Rooms are functional. Not elaborate but decent. Breakfast has a good spread. Staff are courteous.  Overall a pleasant experience, at reasonable price.  The queue for getting a cab during peak hours can be long though. So plan atleast 10 to 15 minutes wait period to get a cab.",8,May-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,We stayed at the Carlton for 4 nights at the start of July. It was so much nicer than we expected. The staff were all very friendly our room was large and very clean and our view of the city was amazing. We used the gym a couple of times and although it was quite small I felt it had everything we needed and was never overcrowded.  The location was excellent for us within a 10 or 20 minute work you could reach many attractions and it was very close to the hop on hop off bus stops. Many restaurants and shops are also close by so we only used a taxi to get to and from the airport. We had a really good stay and if we ever go back we will definitely stay there again!,10,Jul-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"First time in Singapore and the hotel was included in an overall package with an up market tour operator, so we were expecting a decent experience.  We were in an upgraded room, which was spacious and well equipped. Shower wet room was excellent and our view was great, facing outward toward the city skyline (do ask for this and a high floor).  The hotel is smart, with an impressive lobby. Breakfast is pretty good, although naturally catered more to the many Chinese guests.  We also used the pool which was basic, but functional.  On the negatives, none really.....room service was missed once, but rectified immediately and I suppose the hotel is a bit clinical and lacking personality.  Also quite a few times, there was no answer calling reception, so had to call concierge instead.â¦",8,Jun-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,We stayed for 4 nights and from the moment we arrived we had fantastic service. We were able to check in early and our room was lovely overlooking the pool. Everyone we dealt with was friendly and helpful. The buffet restaurant is amazing for breakfast and the poolside bar is great too. We had a late flight and was able to use the pool and showers and our luggage was stored in a locked room. Over the road is 2 metro stations and a massive mall with everything from a supermarket to shops and more eating places than I have ever seen. Will definitely stay again. ,10,Jul-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,We stayed here fro 3 nights after a holiday in Europe. It is probably the best hotel my wife and I have ever stayed in. Location is great. The room was spacious and very clean. The breakfasts superb and the staff were exemplary. A special thanks to Victor Rayappen for his help. This is really a great hotel.,10,Jun-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I have stayed at Carlton hotel Singpaore before without any problems.  During the first night of our recent stay there was an intermittent loud noise coming from what I think was the AC. About every 40 minutes during the whole night there was a 10 seconds shrill loud noise which made it impossible to sleep. I even recorded the sound with my phone before going down to the front desk. I played the noise for them and they said they were sorry and offered another room on a lower floor. The only compensation that was offered was free breakfast. I think that when you BKK a room in a hotel at @Carlton Hotel Singapore, you are mostly paying for a good night sleep. If that is impossible to get in the room that was given to you. Should you then have to pay for that? I think not.  Reallyâ¦",2,Jul-19,

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"We were a family of four, with two children under 4. We stayed for 6 nights. Priorities for us were a convenient location, clean facilities, enough space for all the family and luggage.  The Carlton ticked all of these, however, it does come at a price.  Service-wise, there was no real fault at all. You're met on arrival, luggage taken to the room and check-in was fairly swift. The only thing some might have an issue with is that they do take a deposit. I personally didn't have a big problem with this and the deposit was about 275 SGD. This is to cover things like the minibar I guess, and the full amount was refunded to me. We had breakfast included and the staff there were friendly, especially towards the children.

Not a lap pool, but definitely large enough and deep enough to get some real excercise.  Pool is cleaned frequently.  Poolside bar offers nice drinks.  Restaurants in the hotel attract large crowds on weekends.  The restaurant in the lobby offers a mix of Asian and Western dishes, with a great buffet for breakfast.

We stayed in an Executive Club Room, which offered us plenty of space for a cot (also supplied by the hotel) and a great view over the pool area. Room itself is comfortable and well-maintained, and the Handy smartphone was great to help us navigate the city and make free calls back home. Common facilities are also great, and we made particular use of the dedicated kids' pool.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Having used the Carlton for work and pleasure before. The location for the price in the centre of Singapore is one that canât be beaten. Premium club rooms and the lounge are looking a little dated compared to other properties in the area. However the options are sufficient for pre dinner drinks and breakfast is adequate.

It was also right next to the Raffles hotel, Chijmes establishment that hosts a plethora of mid to high range restaurants, and the Raffles City Mall. Close proximity to the Metro (which you can get to walking thru the mall) was key to my stay as being from the US I was not able to acclimate very well to the heat and humidity of Singapore.

Our room was on the 19th floor (club lounge area.) our breakfast included. Breakfast was adequate with everything you could need and a mix of Asian and the usual western fare.  Room was serviced each day and beds comfortable. Our view from the room wasnât great but you could ask for a good view if needed. Very clean and interesting glass sculptures in foyer. Other places to dine in the hotel. Raffles has many places to suit the choices are fantastic and designer store shopping. 3/4 levels with food in basement level. Perfect stay for us  for the two days.  Views from 19th floor next to dining room. Towards marina bay raffles centreâ¦,8,Aug-19,
Carlton Hotel Singapore,"I will like to write a review compared to similar hotels in Singapore and else where in the world in price bracket and star rating DINING: Paper napkins in dining hall breakfast, 4/ 5 star hotels normally provide a cloth napkin.Not even a tea spoon but a wooden stirrer for coffee. For God's sake I was not at McDonald's.Fruits not cut well,just some chunks cut and thrown in for breakfast. To maintain the start rating the food has to be displayed well  Not adequate staff.A queue to get your eggs made is a terrible idea. And then to collect again. These things are streamlined in most hotels and having an omelette station is a regular thing, The chefs look glum faced ROOMS Not even a wardrobe. We need to keep some stuff away from eyes of staff/ other personnel.Water pressure notâ¦",6,Sep-19,

Carlton Hotel Singapore,I stayed recently for the Formula One event and The Carlton Hotel Singapore is great value for money when compared to the other 5 star hotels slightly closer to the circuit.It is a lot lower price than other nearby hotels but offers a really quick entry through Gate 3.The location is perfect and has Raffles City shopping complex directly over the road.Also Chijmes is across the road and Clarke and Boat Quay are around a 15 minute walk.Chinatown is a little further but easy to walk to in around 20 minutes or so.The rooms are spacious and comfortable and I heard no noise when sleeping.The bed is great and the hotel staff efficient and friendly.I had breakfast as part of the deal and a great selection here.All up a really nice hotel close to the Formula One Circuit and really greatâ¦,10,Sep-19,

The club lounge is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to frequent. We were looked after by Dian and Hat and they were amazing!    All the staff here are excellent, they will do anything to make sure your stay is enjoyable. The selection of food  in the lounge for both breakfast and canapÃ©s in the evening was very, very good.  The only downside (which is the reason the Carlton hasn't received 5 out of 5) is the Wi-Fi. It is really awful, it's advertised as high speed but believe me it isn't and that really makes a difference. The TV is limited so if you want to catch up with the news back home or (as we did stream live football game,) it was problematic. Iâ¦",8,Sep-19,

There is a roller blind that can be pulled down to separate the two rooms when privacy is required. The bed was super comfortable.

We got a package to include a buffet breakfast which catered to all tastes, coffee and tea was not to our liking and thought that it could be improved. Showers area available on the fourth floor so that you may freshen up before your flights after booking out from your room. (Hard to keep things dry in this area. Maybe a storage area to place your suit case whilst in the shower could be included, otherwise suggest that you take the items from your suitcase and leave your bags in the holding area at checkin/checkout area.)",10,Sep-19,

Iâve seen several critical reviews of staff but I found from check in to concierge to cleaning staff everyone was smiling and genuinely helpful  The room was generic hotel but none the worse for that. Highlights were the fabulous mattress and efficient air-conditioning.   The bath was a little small and the control for drain plug was near broken and I had to twice get staff to come and let out the water.   Most disappointed though that lying there in my bubble bath I could only see the tv through the plate glass divider as there was no sound.

While not the newest kid on the block, the Concorde is in a great location and great value. 
The Opel Suite was great value, huge by comparison for others on Orchard Rd.
Faridah who looked after us from check in through to check out was outstanding, even arranged a birthday cake for me and remembered our children's names each time we came down for breakfast (which was great). One of the few places we've stayed where we actually felt at home.

Concorde Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"It is strange that their best rooms are furnished with 2 twin size beds put together to make one large bed, rather then having a king or queen size bed. The staff is accommodating, even though they appear aloof at times. When I checked in  I was upgraded to a room on the premiere floor, which was wonderful, but while the room, the bathroom was large and spacious, the twin beds pushed together was a distraction. I whished it was a full king or queen bed, since I find it difficult to sleep and rest well in a twin size bed. So I asked to be downgraded, but in a room with a king bed. The location of the hotel is good, while far to the center of the shopping malls on Orchard, still within walking distance. 
The restaurant on the main floor, was very spacious yet had that cozy feeling about it. While full of customers, the acoustics were good enough to absorb the harsh tones without creating a noisy surrounding. While I opted for on the card menu, the buffet would have been a better value since the sandwich price with the drink was almost the same as the buffet cost.

The food was magnificent and the daily evening seafood buffet was simply exceptional. Breakfast as unbelievable, so much choice and cooked to perfection, served in Spices.

The room was good and very clean and the reception staff were great.

Far too expensive for the price as there was nothing else there, not even coffee lounge, It had a restaurant for meals at certain times but as far as I could see nothing else. A vast atrium with nothing there except reception and some sofa's and chairs.

On some floors there was a vending machine for chips, nuts and biscuits !!!! that was it.

Also, there was scaffolding work going on for all of August and we were not informed, the noise at times with clanging scaffolding was terrible.

Yes, I know renovations need to be done but then the hotel should compensate with a lower rate or a refund, but no, we still paid the full price.

They did however have an arrangement with a nearby hotel to use their pool. Bed was so comfortable, bathroom modern and very clean, free wifi and cable TV, not that we were in the room much.

The staff went out of our way to help us. The person who checked us in noticed that our daughter was with us, and immediately ordered an extra bed for her. He even walked us to the elevators to make sure we knew where we were going.

They also provide an ""airport trolley,"" which is the luggage cart, right to your door. This was very helpful, although you must abandon it at the end of the connector to the Jewel shopping mall. This means that you must carry everything yourself from that point, which is quite a distance. I don't know what better to do here, and it's really the Jewel's requirement, not Crowne's.

One note: If you look at the hotel on Google Maps, it looks like it's really close to Terminal 1.

Greenhouse looks fantastic so try their lunch and high tea.",10,19-Sep-22,

Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore,Amazing stay with an beautiful view. Definitely a 2nd time.,10,210/10/2022,
Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore,"We absolutely loved the stay. The room and bathroom were clean, spacious, and much fancier than what I was used to. There were robes, nice room slippers (not at all cheap and flimsy), a clean kettle, an assortment of mugs and (wine) glasses, and even a selection of pillows (including a bolster) that could be delivered to your room upon request. The toilet was in its own cubicle with super thick toilet paper and a phone (presumably for when you run out of toilet paper). The toiletries looked and smelled good, and the hairdryer worked great (it was just as strong as my beloved Dyson). Their mobile app was useful too. I had read in older reviews that you're supposed to check in using their app, so I went ahead and downloaded it a few days in advance. The app was a little bit confusing, but I managed to figure it out. You can ""pre-register"" the day before, but can only properly check-in once you're at the hotel and connected to the hotel WiFi. I did the pre-registration, and when we got there, the check-in was very quick and easy. From there on, I could just open the app on my phone to access the key (which you also need in the lift). No worries about lost key cards (unless you lose your phone). The pool area was beautiful. Some of the pool chairs and cabanas were a little bit dirty, but I was fine with that. The towels (which they hand you before you enter the pool) were nice and clean, so you could lay those over the chair before putting your stuff down. I spent more time on the lounge chairs in the wading pool anyway. I loved the openness of the sky, the architecture of the suites, and the planes flying overhead every now and then. They were the main reasons I chose to spend my SRV vouchers at this hotel, and it was worth every cent. If there was a reason I wouldn't go back, it would be that I'd like to try out other places first. I highly recommend this place to anybody with a slightly bigger budget looking for a nice staycation.",10,13-Mar-22,
Fairmont Singapore (SG Clean),Awesome one night stay and great services,10,21-Feb-22,
Fairmont Singapore (SG Clean),Love the hotel. The view from the balcony was spectaculars. Housekeeping was fast and efficient in responding to our request. One and only disappointment is the air conditioner. The hotel will cut down on the usage of the generator between 2am till 6 plus in the morning. I'm guessing they cut cost â¦.

Fairmont Singapore (SG Clean),"Check-in process was quick and simple as I've done it during the pre-arrival. Given relatively a high floor and a view of Raffles Hotel / Duo Tower. This is the Deluxe Room located at South Tower so the room looks newly renovated. Bathtub is huge but I think the shower area can be more well-lit. Quite disappointed as the hotel didn't provide Le Labo shower amenities (as mentioned on their website) and instead, they gave a brand that is relatively cheap. Soundproofing can be better as I heard people talking loudly along the corridor. Had dinner at Prego with the dining credits and breakfast at there too!

Fairmont Singapore (SG Clean),"We chose Fairmont for our wedding anniversary this year. Booking and check-in was a breeze. We decided to upgrade to Deluxe room with a bath tub and was given one in the South tower. The decoration was spanking new, slightly too masculine for my taste. It had an interesting minibar closet which held all your coffee and hot water needs. The door of this minibar, unfortunately had really sharp edges. My husband sustained a cut from it. We got in touch with the Duty Manager, Amanda, who was kind enough to offer a change of room and steriliser to clean the wound. Note: they don't have a an in-house first aid kit. We requested one which had no such minibar and were given one in the North Tower. This is an older room, but it was massive with excellent views. We were grateful for this, and the team's concern. We enjoyed our stay. Please do something about the minibar closet, I fear someone may not be as lucky to escape with a minor wound. Thanks Fairmont.",10,9-Feb-22,

It is not the standard of a 5 star hotel in Singapore to have such low speed internet for a business hotel.  I would highly recommend business people NOT to stay at this Fairmont.

The only thing that I found it unacceptable is that there are dust balls at the spaces between the mattress and the bed frame and there is even a pill. 

And when I asked if I could do late checkout (my sister in another room asked and she said the hotel could offer up to 2pm and asked me to do it), the staff was quite firm that it could only be postponed to 1pm but when I mentioned my sister got 2pm, she changed her stance immediately and said it could be postponed to 2pm.

Fairmont Singapore (SG Clean),"i had planned for a surprise staycation with my girlfriend as it was her birthday weekend. however, the mood was dampened by the downtime and lack of wifi/ internet connection in the hotel throughout our whole hotel stay. perhaps it was just our luck that the wifi had to be down. however, i was terribly disappointed with the service of the hotel staff and inability of the IT technicians to fix the problem immediately. we had checked in on Saturday, of which when we noticed the problem, we inquired with the receptionist immediately. we were informed that the internet had been down since the previous night. when we checked out on sunday at noon, the problem still wasn't fixed. i'm appalled that a 5-star hotel like them doesn't have speedy and strong resolution response when such an issue arises. not only was the wifi down, the TV had extremely bad connection, and we couldn't watch any shows/cable connection movies the whole night at all. it was just an extremely disappointing experience.

in addition, there was this fancy looking water dispenser in the room. no qualms about it however, i suspect that there's a leak/ problem with the equipment, as the water had tasted weird, with a tinge of iron/ funny taste when we tried to drink water from it. we immediately threw the water away. 

the hotel staff were reluctant to offer us any partial refund, despite the bad service received.

the only saving grace was that the bed was comfortable. 

otherwise, disappointing overall.",4,11-Jan-20,

Perfect. Just disappointed that there was no mention about renovations taking place until December, which we could hear as we got off the lift. Even though it was a walk in the opposite direction when we got to our rooms we could still hear the drilling - which goes until 830pm. Fortunately our plans were such that we were not in the hotel until after that time. In all fairness the hotel offered to move us to a higher floor but by then it was day two of our stay and my elderly mother had unpacked and was reluctant to move.

The service staff were friendly and helpful, and as an added bonus, they took the initiative to get to know my name and interact with me when I was not otherwise preoccupied. The absence of the stiff formality that characterizes the service at many major hotels made me feel welcomed and at ease.   Amenities are excellent, as should be expected, and clients who had joined me at the hotel for business had commended the layout, facilities, and atmosphere.

Furama RiverFront,What kind of service would you expect when you have just 2 staff working at front desk in a hotel with so many rooms??Every time we visited at the desk people kept waiting because they were under staffed Infact Front desk was handling concierge game too..with just 2 of them.

Big plug for Peterasp in the bar .Very professional customer service oriented. He should go far. I wish I knew the mans name at the door, chubby fellah with glasses also very good and worthwhile.

Was counting days to meet up with siblings but days were made moving quicker with needs being anticipated by kind hearted human being serving at their best. Fear of being ill-treated was making me feel butterflies in my stomach but then i was proved wrong when my special day was celebrated here. Was given a suprise cake and a beautiful card by Sanjiv and Vivian (spelling refered to Sanjiv.. Haha). I was shocked as this was the 1st time i celebrated my birthday without my family and i was happy that they took the effort to make my special day into a wonderful one.

Furama RiverFront,"It was my first time at this rather beautiful lounge in Furama Riverfront. In fact, it was my very first time stepping into this hotel. There is no doubt that this hotel establishment has been around for a long while and had seen better days, but the Waterfall Lounge's high ceiling and gorgeous full-height glass wall looking out to the greenery certainly impressed me.  I was there for a one-off burger collaboration with @GreasyboySG. Our slot was for 7pm, but we arrived early at 6pm to enjoy a drink and some appetizers from the bar. Whilst the salmon sashimi and cocktail prawns was alright, the raw oysters were really enjoyable and a good deal.

Besides that environment at the waterfall lounge is also suitable for focused revision. Moreover, service here is extremely great for anyone to deny this fact. They are all pretty attentive, polite and kind towards their guest. Out of all, might want to highlight 2 of them who can be seen attending to almost all the guest whenever they are at work would be Sanjiv and Thae.

Furama RiverFront,Interesting to step into the hotel again after a while for a workshop and they have done up the place pretty well.

Over the last years, Iâve been visiting some local hotels, service apartments, including Pan Pacific, Meritus, Ascott and Millenium be it for work or leisure. This time round, I was amazed by the service quality rendered by Mr Sanjiv, when I was merely trying out their Work From Hotel service which I came across recently. Knowing that I was new to the hotel, Mr Sanjiv very patiently explained to me on the benefits which I am entitled to, and what should I do from ordering of food, to making full use of the benefits.

Its seems like all the middle aged service crew including the manager/supervisor has an attitude when it comes to providing service to the customers.   I am a day pass and I usually head to the Waterfall Lounge which is great. But today i decide to head up to The Square and it feels like a whole new world when it comes to service attitude.   1. They constantly takes more than 15 minutes and at times 30 minutes to serve you your drink 2. When you page them for staff assistance using the app, many times they even refuse to come attend to you 3.

This was an easy decision due to the high cost of drinks in Singapore and was the bargain of this trip. The food was excellent and the drinks were free flowing and included imported bottled cider and lager. The Waterfall lounge is a beautiful place and the waitressâs ensured your glass was never empty, it definitely added extra value. The room upgrade even included a Wi-Fi hotspot to provide uninterrupted internet access across Singapore. All in all a lovely comfortable, friendly hotel close to all amenities.",8,Feb-20,

The Lobby Layout was confusing as I was unable to find clear and/or distinct signs that direct me to the front desks. When I found the front desk, I realised it was hidden behind a pillar 'strategically'. The Front Office staffs were friendly, nonetheless, and the check-in process was hassle-free.  The room I received was with dated decoration, furniture and colour scheme. There was a huge stench of dust, probably from the carpeted floor and I was sneezing the whole night since I was allergic to dust mites.

Furama RiverFront,This modern hotel was a big let down. Looked good from the outside but not inside. It was like a school playground inside.

Furama RiverFront,Myself and my cousin stayed at this amazing place for 10nights and from the very first step into the hotel we felt at home with warm greetings from all the staff. My cousin booked our package being the Executive Clubroom package which included buffet breakfast and 2hr of free flowing Spirits and beers from 6pm-8pm daily ð»ð¥ and bar nibbles. This package is so totally worth it and I highly recommend it. From the start the manager Rommel looked after us as did all of the staff members which really made our stay feel like home and more than comfy. The pool and gym were both fantastic clean and easy to access. The Wifi was great to keep in touch with family and access was easy.

The best thing about Furama, apart from the generous cocktails, beverages and canapÃ©s that were included with our room, were the staff.  We were taken care of, every night, by Yazid and Salim in the waterfall lounge and could not have annoyed ourselves more.  Both being hotel chefs back in Melbourne, the customer service that we received from both of these gentlemen was absolutely outstanding.

Furama RiverFront,Stay in this beautiful hotel was certainly one of the best we have ever encountered in our travelling journey before the lockdown. The lobby was fully furnished with multi use amenities and it was looking more to a complex than a hotel. The concept was amazing. The highlight here would surely be the level of service rendered by their staff to their guest and it was heart warming to see friendly staffs around. Special shout-out to Sanjiv from the reception team who was there for us all the time we needed something.

It was unfortunate that we were unable to use the bridal suite due to the Covid 19 restrictions as a SHN hotel but I'm sure the stay would have been equally pleasant as our experience working with them. Thank you Furama for the hospitality and service for our special day!",10,May-22,
Furama RiverFront,"Held my wedding lunch at Furama Riverfront Waterfall Lounge and the whole process of planning and preparation under the coordination of Albert Liew.

What made it more enjoyable was your staffâs attentiveness and friendliness!  We were at the provision, attended by Man Loong and  we bought a chain.

Me and my partner liaised with Elaine regarding the details of our wedding and Elaine was a very patient and  hard working staff of Furama Riverfront. Every question we asked, she answered them well and she put our mind at ease. Her replies are fast and she gets things done very efficiently. Even the day before the wedding, Elaine and her team were able to accommodate to last minute changes. The food was also delicious and well portioned for our guests. I would say it was a smooth journey holding my wedding at Furama Riverfront thanks to Elaine and her team.

Furama RiverFront,"Been many years since our last dining experience at Kintamani restaurant Furama Hotel in Singapore.  The price is good for a dinner buffet with generous discounts for children and senior citizens too. Add on $3 for free flow of hot or cold drinks.  Ooo the curry crabs were fresh and yumz! If there was mantou buns too, that would have been perfect! I do believe the buffet menu changes so check out their website.

The only downside was the hotel rooms were reserved for SHN accommodation. Recommended place to host your lifetime event.",8,May-22,

This is a special shout out to the night duty manager Michael Gabriel Hernandez! On the first night of my stay I realised that my TV was not working, called & was assisted by Michael. He was warm and prompt & suggested changing to another room at my convenience.   And on the second night I realised that I left my charger at the old room, when I spoke to Michael he immediately empathised with my situation and patiently explained how he could help me. Within 10 mins I got a cable that he borrowed for me. To me, this is exemplary service and going the extra mile for the guest! Kudos!!! And I am certain that your serviceâ¦",10,Mar-22,

Furama RiverFront,"Just when i thought good service was dead then came along this guy.   Bought a voucher from chope, came to restaurant but didnt know we had to also make the reservation beforehand but honestly it was not a big deal for us so we sat down nearby to plan where to have lunch instead, it was our own fault anyways for not checking.   Saleem suddenly came to us saying that he already prepared a table for us. We were like âyou sure? Its ok if we have to come back another day for the tableâ to which he said âplease i insist, yall got small kidsâ. He could tell that we felt quite bad but he made sure we were well fed and taken cared off.

Furama RiverFront,Nice food and great service. We didn't know that we still need to book a reservation after purchasing voucher from Chope. So when we reach there they were having event so its not open for public. Its my fault for not calling. But the boss so kind to still accept us and gave us an isolation room to separate us from the event. We were very thankful for that. Everything  was 5 star the food the service. Special thanks to Salim the server for his excellent service. I will definitely recommend people to dine in here. It's actually my first time experiencing good service thanks to Salim.

Furama RiverFront,Always a pleasant experience when we arrive here in furama riverfront. We've been coming for this work from hotel scheme since they launched it in Aug 2020. So it's been almost 1.5 years.   We enjoy the benefits like free parking and free flow beverages all day round for yourself and a guest. The monthly pass is very worth it as it also comes with $150 credits which you can use for dining at their restaurants too.   Ms Virginia is always full of energy whenever she sees us at the space. She is friendly and ensures that we are well taken care of.   This is truly a best working/studying/chillout space for all.,10,Feb-22,
Furama RiverFront,"Stayed in a theme room which was nice for the kids. They enjoyed the entertainment in the room, as well as their time at Waka Waka. Room was spacious as well.   Now the downsides:  No housekeeping the entire 4 days stay. Apparently due to covid restrictions. But with kids, room & toilet are bound to get dirty. Not to mention, trash is not emptied. If theyâre not doing it for us, there should at least be a rubbish area for us to throw it ourselves. I actually saw someone left a bag of rubbish at the lift lobby, disgusting.   Service is mediocre. Waited 45 mins for a mere pizza at Waterfall, no apologies whatsoever. Requested for someone to fix the shower head, no one turned up.  And get used to random drillings even at 7am or 11pm. ð¤¦ð»ââï¸",6,Aug-22,

Furama RiverFront,"Have stayed at this Hotel on occasions previously but never again. Executive floor rooms dirty, tied & need update. Check in / out slow, exc lounge disgraceful. Breakfast buffet poor. Room service only after repeated requests. Spoke to other guests who expressed same frustration. Lastly why on earth would you place a Childrens play ground in your entrance foyer?",2,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,"Started bad with miscommunication in bedding configuration - requested for 3 single solid beds but been given extra roll over bed instead. Checked in was quite late on the first night but been promised the solid bed the next day still didnt happened. Third day been promised room change to 3 single beds room but did not happened too. Jiv stepped in to resolve this by upgrading our room but didnt take it as well as family room 2 queens beds does not suit our requirements. Jiv has made extra effort by offering breakfast and exeutive club benefits. Thanks to Jiv for listening to our issue, attentive , extraordinary customer service resulted in truly satisfactory stay during our trip.",10,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,"This is a halal hotel, the rooms are not serviced unless you stay four nights or longer,no clean towels no rubbish bins cleaned and they give you a glass water jug you can fill up from a tap near the lifts. The breakfast buffet is halal which is a change but not what we were used to and most of the hot dishes are cold or lukewarm. These facts should be told to us before you book and also the riverfront is ten minutes walk away.",2,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,"I think this hotel is slightly more advanced in terms of technology as compared to Furama City Centre, such as the carpark e-coupon and check-in. You may self check-in, but ultimately still requires a staff to finish the whole process. The room I booked was fully occupied so the staff gave me a complimentary upgrade to Club Room (without the club benefits). The room was huge and situated at a high floor. TV also comes with Netflix access. Toilet was of a decent to large size. Do note that the room is a little dated but I believe that the hotel is going through some renovations progressively. Overall, my partner and I enjoyed our stay!",8,Aug-22,
Furama RiverFront,"The hotel runs on an autopilot mode. Everything and anything has to be requested, ordered using an online chatbot only. Its very frustrating, room service works through online ordering with prepaid only option. Housekeeping amenities have to be collected / picked by the guest from the ground floor themselves each time you want something. Room cleaning is done only after 3 nights, drinking water to be filled everytime you want from the RO/filter on each floor. Requesting anything you need in the room attracts a $5 delivery charge.  Overall, not a hotel we would want to go back to or recommend to anything.",4,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,Stayed here for 30 days and the information manager Miss Mae helped me all with my inquiries. Room cleaning had been perfectly done every day. Would come back here anytime! Would recommend staying here for my family members as well.,10,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,This is worst hotel ever...this is 4* hotel it seems.. not even qualified to be a 2*.....there will be no one to carry the luggage.. no room service.. no one responds to your call.. no towels & toiletries given...Cleaning the room once in 3 days.. no one talks politely.... Reception staff so rude & Arrogant & yells in local language...Breakfast was so yuck n bland AF... Endless i can point the qualities of this hotel none good...

Furama RiverFront,"Being in the same industry, I would like to compliment SANJIV or he is better known as JIV for his top top top quality customer service rendered to his guest which makes anyone feels like family and at home. Many years in hospitality, it's rare to see such attitude filled with politeness, empathy, cheerful and very positive whenever anyone approaches him despite the hotel being at peak occupancy. While assisting other guests, helping hand was also given to his colleagues who came over to him. I am writing this specifically because I was extremely impressed with his positive attitude and this gentleman also taught me how exactly service should look like.

Furama RiverFront,"I had stayed in this hotel from 28/8/2022 to 02/09/2022. Reached hotel at around 9 am, while check in time was 2 pm. My travel agent hadrequested for an early check in. When I went to the reception to ask if any rooms available as i had requested earlier, they were not even ready to check my details at first place & even without checking their records just refused to entertain & asked me to come back after 2 hrs. After 2 hrs again same issue. Some people arrived later on got rooms earlier than me.  They claim to be 4 star. But rooms are not upto the standard of 4 star. Lifts are old so is the furniture & other facilities. Restaurant where breakfast is served is another nightmare. No enough table so you will be forced to share with strangers. Most of the staff at reception or concierge or restaurant are either arrogant or not willing to help guests. I had a very bad experience with their staff Rajan (Natarajan). He is in the gate to help guests to keep their baggage, call taxi etc. One day when I requested to call taxi, he said he will do. We waited for about half an hour. He was trying to call free taxis going  on the street but none came by. Then one lady (i don't know her nationality) came & asked this guy to call taxi. He went inside & within 5 minutes a taxi came. I was surprised & asked him why no taxi for me. He said I called taxi thru hotel booking system where they will charge 2-3 dollar extra. I said you could have told me this before, i could have booked the same as i have lost half an hour. You were just waiving free taxis on the road. He replied to me saying, if you want to call taxi from street you can do so I can not help you etc.  He started shouting. Then i reminded him that don't shout, I am your guest so talk politely. Then he apologized with half heart and called a taxi. He was an Indian origin Singaporean who didn't want to be identified as Indian !!  I noticed in Singapore, locals are arrogant. Especially people of Indian origin. They feel ashamed of saying Indian origin but they will sell ""authentic Indian food"".    In general my visit was an eye opener as to how hype and over rating can attract tourists while in reality only 50% is true.â¦",2,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,"4*? In what universe?   2* with a posh foyer on a good day.   If you like cupboard doors hanging off, a sink that takes  5 minutes to drain yet still somehow doesn't seal long enough to have a shave. Light switches that have no lights, a fan in the bathroom that doesn't work.  Toilet seat that doesn't actually fit the toilet. No room service in the nights we stayed.  I guess this place was built in the 70s / 80s and has never benefited from maintenance since.   Rooms are tired, certainly 611 is, but it's a great room if you like the sound of the elevaltors all night.  Plus points. Beds comfortable,  linen crisp.  A/C works but a little too noisy to have on to sleep. Decent shower.   I strongly recommend you find somewhere else. For a modern city like Singapore this place simply doesn't deserve a 4* rating.â¦",4,Sep-22,
Furama RiverFront,"Our flight was cancelled by the 'good old' Jetstar not once but twice. Our inward trip to Singapore and the Furama Hotel was cancelled 11 hours before our flight! Our return flight was also cancelled and we were told 'at the airport'. I spent 8.5 hours re-booking the first flight and the Furama Hotel. I had to re-call the Furama back  to advise them that Jetstar could only get us back to OZ  3days after the original change earlier that day. This was all done and listed. Before I start to describe the Furama, I will explain what happed there. At least 3 times during our stay there I mentioned to the staff on the main desk about the additional 3 days extension on our stay to which I was assured "" yes Sir that is all in order. IT WASN'T. When we reached the ORIGINAL day of booking end I checked that our continuation was all OK to be told "" we have no record of that extension and no spare rooms to offer!!! so out you go! They did find us another hotel which turned out to be much nicer, altough it cost me another $630.00! The Furama itself is only a three star and not the claimed 4 star. The rooms were clean, the staff were excellent, some of the meals a bit ordinary and often served half cold! Everything was expensive but considering Singapore is the eighth most expensive city on earth it was not much of a surprise to see huge bills. The position of the Hotel was great, easy access to all parts. Taxies were in short supply. Overall, not a bad hotel but in need of a refit.

Furama RiverFront,"I don't even know where to begin with this hotel. We stayed here for 5 nights, and were looking forward to staying here because the pictures looked quite nice. When we first came into the hotel, the lobby was clean and renovated, but as soon as we got to our floor, we realized how awful this hotel was.   The floors were carpeted, stained, and smelly, and they gave us a terrible room by the back radiator overlooking the dumpsters. We ran back to the lobby and it wasn't until we had a big argument with someone working at the reception that we got a bit of a nicer room not overlooking dumpsters (emphasis on bit). Everything was broken - hair dryer, blinds, the beds were the most uncomfortable, old beds we have ever slept on with terrible mattresses. Not for anyone with back problems.   We tried to spend as little time here as possible and were so happy to leave on our last day.   Some pluses: good location close to the river and central. Otherwise, stay away.â¦",6,Sep-22,

Due to COVID some services are changed as minimum staff interaction , limited room service (we had not avail any room service may be they provided to premium customers) and room cleaning after third night if you ask they clean at your request. No water provided but a water dispenser in lobby and  tea, coffee, sugar provided with a oven for heating food.  Electric kettle provided in room for making tea. We booked Queen Studio (though agent who changes to this hotel from a 3 star hotel in little India) , room is too small as compare to India 7' wide only without any closet. you have to adjust your clothes on wall hanger, which is not good for 4 star hotel. initially we are not happy with room. But View was good from 9th floor. Breakfast is decent with Indian, continental and local food but of fresh juice is limited and no marking of veg- non veg on food which may be not good for Indian vegetarian, i personally liked idly with coconut chatni , chicken sausage and cup cakes.â¦",10,Sep-22,

Although we were given twin beds despite our req for king bed, we were very happy and decided to take the room for us to get a good sleep.

The room was spacious and clean, we looked at the breakfast buffet option however it was better value to go out and eat each day.

There seems to be a lack of manpower to handle the guest load.   - Long queue at concierge for check in - Despite arriving at 3 pm, all rooms were not ready despite an email assuring that we could have all three tropical king rooms side by side. This means that there are likely not enough housekeeping to turnover the rooms in time The helpless staff could only release one king 'showroom' which our family group could spend time in first - Went down at 4 pm to queue again, only one more room was ready - tropical twin right at the end of the same level.

He was so friendly and polite and got us in the correct room right away, bonus it was on a higher floor with better views so it was no trouble to move our things after the mix up.

The location is also fine however absence of MRT station nearby is a big drawback. The check out was also smooth & facilities of gym and pool was there. Now coming to the problem areas, the breakfast of the hotel was mediocre, there is no live egg station and menu is almost the same everyday so for 7 days we ended up eating almost same menu. The other issue is due to Covid protocols the rooms gets cleaned in every three days, we stayed for a week so technically room should have been cleaned twice but despite the second cleaning scheduled on 6th day the room was not cleaned despite calling operator and front desk peopleâ¦",4,Sep-22,

Teeni who was on duty was very helpful and friendly with the room reservation process.    * Check- in: was not smooth as hotel had a problem with room allocation.

They were not able to rectify it for the four days we stayed at the hotel. 2) MRT station is a bit far (Outram park or Chinatown) 3) Room cleaning done only once in four days.

We waited in line a full hour. We didnât mind as the place was clearly understaffed. But then the staff we talked to seemed  indifferent and even unfriendly (we donât blame themâmost likely theyâre stressed due to said understaffing issue). They all struggled with the checkin computers. We asked nicely for an âokayâ view. We were put in a room next to the elevator shaft with a view of a moldy dirty wall.

We saw that every single instruction was typed out and noted in a document and it was then said to be passed on to the banquet operations department.

Furama RiverFront,"10 days isolation order was served in the wonderful hotel and i was very satisfied with their service and empathy shown by their staff. Knowing that i had difficulty and i was weak to carry my luggage upon arriving, i was assisted by one of their Staff, Sanjiv. While providing my lunch, he also showed some sympathy and gave me additional mineral water to drink so that i could recover soon. Few days later was called by their reception staff Amelia and she too was kind to ask if i was doing well and that kind lady wished me for a speedy recovery. The hotel has done a great job appointing staffs like them in showing empathy towards their guest and i feel very satisfied with their service. Thank you for the great service.",10,Nov-21,

Prices are very reasonable for the monthly passes where you can get free flow of drinks for yourself and a guest, free parking plus dining credits with exclusive discounts on their food items plus free passes to the Waka Waka indoor playground.   We especially loved their hospitality. They remembered us everytime we checked in and always joyful to assist us in any way possible.

Staffs were very friendly from the 1st day and choice of food given to choose between halal and normal. Hotel was so supportive towards their guest by calling constantly and one day when i forgot to take my lunch that was provided, my door bell was rang again and the gentleman named Sanjiv asked if everything was okay and gave a few words of courage to keep myself going well to recover soon.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I checked-in to this hotel with some trepidation after reading the reviews. The check-in was smooth. But that was where the good things came to a halt. The lobby has a dated looking light installation. The furniture in the lobby area need to be re-upholstered. There is an atm, money exchange, convenience store on-site, so that's helpful. The room was small and did not resemble the hotel website pics at all. The bathroom had mould in the sink and shower areas. The toiletries were sub-standard. To come back to my room after every outing felt like a punishment. The air-con system worked fine. The staff at the coffee shop and bar were helpful. Even with a long overdue renovation in the pipeline, for guests who had to stay in this hotel under such poor room conditions, I felt cheated.",6,Aug-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"If I could give this hotel a big fat zero, I would.   Dropped them an email with a feedback. It has been more than a week and still no replies. So Iâm posting this here, hoping to get their attention.   My husband booked a room on the Club floor for my Birthday on 30 July 2022. Front desk greeting, room decor and card all said âHappy Anniversaryâ. But thatâs fine, mistakes happen.   Eventually, the straw that broke the camelâs back was the service (or the lack thereof) we received from Jennifer, who was manning the counter at the Club floor the next day at around 2pm.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Disappointed this stay. Have previously stayed in a club room, so expectations may have been too high, as we just had a superior room this stay.  The main disappointment was the cleanliness. I donât usually check detail but I lost the back off my earring and while searching the floor was not impressed with the amount of fluff and dirt. The staff were all helpful but I wouldnât say outstanding, I found the breakfast items to be on the cold side, and with only 1 chef on the egg station it was easier to avoid the line. I must commend assistance with late departure. It was great to store luggage and be able to use the pool facilities to shower before our flight, Thankyou. If I was to stay again, I would go for a club room as we had wonderful service last time.",6,Jul-22,

I can honestly say she is simply amazing effective and made our stay absolutely perfect in every possible way.,10,Oct-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Overall, I truly enjoyed the stay during my trip to Singapore. Although the hotel has its flaws, I received excellent service especially from Rodney, who perfectly handled my complaint regarding the room. He responded quickly and gave my family and I a great solution which made my stay at this hotel even more memorable. Frankly speaking, Iâd only wanted to rate this hotel 3 to 4 stars due to the poor condition of the room but after how calmly and tactfully Rodney handled my complaint, I decided to give you guys 5 stars!",10,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"A big thanks to your excellent lounge team - Shirley , Jenifer, Kenneth n also to your night managerRodney .â¨â¨  Shirley is just amazing in 1 word! Her colleague Jennifer a beautiful sweet lady took good care of us when we came for evening cocktail. Kenneth, a friendly gentleman made sure we were comfortable n well-served at all times. We enjoyed some really nice cold beer. Service at the lounge is a top notch! And Rodney heâs so accommodating n a very nice boy, addressed to all our needs in the middle of the night. We were really moved as he made our long hard days so much better. I was taken aback when told by 1 of the bell captain that he is the night manager,because he has got the look of a kid who will never grow up, very adorable(not an insult but rather a compliment). The room however,was rather old n require some renovating works. Except for the room situation, it was truly an awesome experience we will never forget, very good service from 4 of your wonderful staff we feel we didnât deserve.â¦",10,Oct-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Good location for a business trip to access all but no Restaurant around the hotel. The price was a little higher due to F1 racing, I think. There is no shopping center or restaurant nearby, so it is not a good location to go out late in the evening. So it's not good for tourists, but I want to recommend it to business travelers.",10,Sep-22,

Staff were good, but the reservation desk seemed to take a lot of key strokes and a bit of time on check in. ",8,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I stayed here  for 4 nights last week - I was a lil concerned due to recent reviews... But to be honest, I thought it would be worse that what I experienced.   The check in process was ok - I was expecting a disaster as I got a check-in email asking what time I would arrive (and a time slot option I should pick) as there were many ppl expected. The first time Ive received anything like this from all of my travels.  The rooms were a bit disappointing. Old carpet - the type you dont want to walk on with wet feet.... deliberately darker colored. The shower was pretty bad... looked like it hasnt been upgraded since the 90's.   The location of the hotel is its best feature. Close to Henderson and Clark Quay and all of the bars / coffee shops / restaurants etc.   The breakfast was quite a disappointment - So busy! I had booked for 4 breakfasts but attended 1. I preferred to go out and buy brekky elsewhere...   Would I return? Maybe - if I got a cheaper price. Its worth $100-$150 per night. Not more.â¦",8,Sep-22,

Perfect location in Robertson Quay, walking distance to many restaurants / cafes on the waterfront, and also restaurants/cafes downstairs inside the hotel for easy business catch-ups. The Club Level rooms are particular nice and modern, great views, quiet and clean. Solid and enjoyable. Good to relax after a busy day of meetings. Easy access to other parts of the city - everything in a short 3-8 min Grab/GoJek, or you can walk all along Robertson Quay/Clarkson Quay. The Front Desk Manager Navin Seh was particularly helpful for our booking of several rooms and also helping with extending stay. Ended up staying here for additional 5 days. Very professional and helpful. Ask for Navin Seh if you need anything! He's the best! Great stay,  perfect place for business travel, the rooms were very spacious, room service food from downstairs is convenient and great, and neighborhood is convenient and walkable.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"What a wonderful experience trashing my initial thoughts of how to cope with being ""imprisoned"" all be it even at a 5 star hotel? The moment I arrived at 2+am on the 18th June was a breeze with courtesy received. Entering the room #2306 was a relief with spacious, very clean and well equipt with neccesities. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The view gave me the serenity needed for this situation as it faces the Singapore river and city view even Batam can be seen on a clear day. Very good wifi connection helps keep my sanity intact.  Most of all what was more stunning was the great guest oriented hotel personnel which truly was amazing and what guests always expected nomatter what the situation or reason to stay can be. I must humbly commend them for making mine a pleasantly memorable one...   To Jiun Lee and Cheryl from 'One Touch' for keeping me company with their friendly and sincerity I can feel just over our daily telephone conversations and I was very pleasantly surprised that them knowing I'm a BTS ARMY presented me with an encouragement greeting card with BTS poster print! Now that was AWESOME! Liya (hope I spelt it correctly) from the same department was enthusiastic when we spoke on my checking out day. To all of you, gamsahamidah...  To GCW Hotel Manager Mr Terence Ng, my sincere appreciation for taking good care of me in making my stay trouble and stress free. You have a great team!

The only helpful person here was the maid who brought few extra towels in the room. The hotel manager on duty canât be contacted for complaints, you have to relay the feedback to a phone operator who will give it to the front desk, to be burried somewhere !

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"we were given a room that was filthy and mouldy the carpets were disgusting, under the bed there was at least 2 - 3 months of dust, the fridge was filthy , The smell from the very mouldy bathroom ceiling was eye watering , after waiting 2 - 3 hours we were given another room that was not great, for this quality hotel you would expect a stocked bar fridge. Breakfast was hit and miss, maybe the worst we have encountered in the last  20 years of travelling. The meal service in the hotel is very poor, when ordering a main meal or snack they came out staggered so when one had finished eating the other meal would arrive, on our last evening there we noticed the theme board for drink and meal promotions was actually out side the hotel"" which was a well kept secret. It would have beenâ¦",2,Jul-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights in May this year and we are a family of four. It has all the amenities one needs and is neat and clean. The beds are very comfortable. We slept well each night. I would highly recommend it for its location as it has many eateries in Clarke Quay within walking distance. There is a seven eleven nearby too. We loved walking along the river and experience the buzz and the nightlife around. We took cabs mainly so didnât use any other public transport. The hotel does have a bus stand nearby to get around. It is close to most of the sights and areas of interest in Singapore. The boat cruise station is also walking distance from this hotel, about 15mins.   The reviews for this hotel mentioned a lot about the breakfast and we were not expecting muchâ¦",8,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,At first we were nervous but the GM Mr Gagan and reception staff were very cooperative . My recommendation is pay extra for the 29th floor without the club lounge as rooms are very spacious with a Bath Tub.   Good breakfast options and check in takes time but if we check in online ....it's quick . They should have a separate line for pre registered guests.  ,10,Jul-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Pros: Overall I liked my stay at the hotel. Good service and good sized rooms. The breakfast buffet was of good value.   It appears as if the hotel is near the mass transit lines. Itâs easy to get to the pedestrian ridge to access the waterfront restaurants.   I recommend this hotel.   Cons: I had to spend my last night in Singapore at another hotel. This was my fault.,10,Jul-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Generally a very good hotel. It had good value for money, especially considering that most good hotels in Singapore are very expensive. Access to Clarke Quay which had a vibrant night life was easy. Unfortunately transport to/from the hotel was hindered by the need to call for taxis or ubers. The MRT station across the road was not operational. The MRT connectivity should improve when this station is opened.",8,Jul-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Hotel rooms are apparently due a refurbishment in October 2022. However, the current rooms are very run down and most disappointingly, unclean and full of dust.  Issues noted during last stay - dusty rooms, floor has not been dusted enough despite whatever SG clean standard is meant to be. Ripped furniture- leather and cloth covering on chairs Mould on sink joining to the basin Rusty water sprinklers Stains on furniture including bed frame and desk.  Badly in need of a refresh and actually maintaining cleanliness standards.  Staff are friendly and professional, just let down by the current standards of the rooms. At current prices and positioning as a 5-star hotel, you are probably better off findind something else in Singapore",2,Sep-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We have recently stayed in the executive level of this hotel as part of a group of 6. Let me say, the extra $ it costs more than makes up for the friendliness and hospitable staff of Shirley, Kenneth, Jennifer and Megan.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We stayed 8 nights at the Grand Copthorne and originally booked a king room and decided when we arrived to upgrade to a deluxe king room only because we were told they were bigger and more suitable for an 8 day stay. The upgrade was granted for an extra fee of $30++. which we accepted. Being put in an old deluxe king room was disappointingÂ to say the least, old carpets and skirting boards that haven't been cleaned for many years were spotted straightÂ away, with the all black marbleÂ shower and finding the black door stop on the shower floor was dangerous. Another room was asked for and it was a newer room, cleaner and simply had been re-painted, new carpet and wall decorations.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,We stayed in these hotel for 5 nights. Here are our observations.   Welcome - None  Wifi- Free & works well  Parking - Self Parking  Rooms - We stayed in their premier room +300sqft. The room offers decent view of the city and the river. The beds were comfy. The decor was from the 90s. Not 5 star standard. Needs renovation for sure.  Housekeeping- Was hit and miss. Sometimes the room was done well Sometimes they forgot things.  Service - The service desk received our call most of the times and requests were fulfilled.   Breakfast - The breakfast was decent. The place is kind of small compared to the no. Of guest. Otherwise all good.  Overall - a nice hotel with decent amenities and service. Consider it as a 4 star property you wont be disappointed. ,6,Aug-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Bad experience.  Total disappointment.  The room had no windows to be opened. Bad smell in the room. When I asked to change my room to one with a window,that opens,the hotel receptionist said- I should add +280 $ for 2 nights to upgrade my room. Couldn't imagine so far,that you have to pay to get fresh air!!! It was impossible to sleep during the night,no fresh air...Felt like being in a cell. Breakfast also,leaves much to be desired! They charge huge rates for poor quality service!",2,Jul-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Terrible experience with bar manager on the evening of  Friday July 29.

The evening then started early over a digital book at the lounge. Shirley was great at handling my early arrival - I got a juice to get me thru the hr of reading and as soon as the bar and snacks were ready, Kenneth came along with the best kimchi to go with chips.

Even though the voucher expired a year later, the hotel was understanding enough to still let us redeem it a  year after expiry due to the fluid Covid situation.

Great hotel with great memories, service remained top notch despite 2 years of pandemic.",10,Jul-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"For what you pay - it was a very valuable stay with great amenities and service. Checkin and departure was a seamless process and the stay was enjoyable with good proximity to key areas in Singapore.

You ask for anything you have to wait for a long time and chase them up. ",2,Aug-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,We had problems trying to check an early check-in where the listed price on the website changed to over double the price when I phoned to see if I could get a confirmation for the early check-in.  Early check out was a disaster with the breakfast arriving 30 minutes late! Bathrooms are small and the sink flooded the vanity surface every time it was turned on.

We were still excited to stay here to end our 14 day holiday as the pictures of the room looked good and it was 5*. Our negative experience started when we tried to check in. 45 minutes we had to wait while one person was on the desk trying to sort check in and manage guest complaints at a peak time. When we finally got to our room, we were overcome with disappointment. The smell, the decor, the old TV and the watermarked ceiling greeted us.

The waiting and processing was so much better - highly recommend anyone to do e-check in first.  For both staycations, I was wowed by the service of the staff at both the reception, as well as in the restaurant.   Tip: As the housekeeping staff are mainly migrant workers, it would help them to understand your needs better if you are able to speak their native language instead of English. However, they are very courteous and willing to help.  Room wise - decent size but decor is dated. As this property is pretty old, do expect some signs of aging in the room facilities.

This is an older hotel whose grandeur is a bit faded but it was an extremely clean, comfortable, and well serviced hotel. The breakfast buffet caters for all tastes and diets and is excellent value. The hotel staff are attentive, friendly and helpful. The position on the Singapore River is close to many good bars and eateries.  A small niggle was the lack of an adjacent MRT station but one is currently under construction just minutes away. We stayed for just under 2 weeks and enjoyed most facilities.

Staff were relatively pleasant   however considering we had mentioned it was our honeymoon there were no âspecial treatmentâ  services given not even a simple towel decoration. This was the first stop of our multi destination and Copthorne were the only hotel who I would say didnât make us feel special or even congratulate us on our newlywed status.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I booked a 6 night stay at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel and I had a pleasant stay. The staff were friendly and helpful. A few things that were minor inconveniences: -I had one outlet that I could plug my adapter/devices in (luckily it had two USB plugs, so I could charge 3 devices at once) -One of the four curtain handles were missing, but I didn't care too much as it was much easier to open and close the curtain with my hand -The shower door wouldn't close all the way properly, so the door would be slightly ajar during a shower -The closet door would not slide shut all the way and so I used a slipper/sock in between the cracks of the two doors to keep one of the doors shut -The location is not the greatest but it does give you a nice view of the river, which is alsoâ¦",8,Sep-22,

Special thanks to Jennifer for her wonderful service in the lounge and Rodney at the reception.â¨â¨  My wife and I arrived in the wee hours of the morning after a 17-hr flight, and we were warmly greeted by a lovely boy Rodney, who gave us the best hospitality! He was very polite and accommodating to our requests and even walked us to the elevator after checking us in. â¨â¨  We had a room with lounge access which was delightful.

They even surprised me with a birthday cake on my birthday which Iâll never forget. Nothing was ever a problem we always had everything we needed, they went to any length to make sure our stay was comfortable & enjoyable. These are the people you want to be working in a hotel to make it memorable & to always have a wonderful stay on holidays. There hospitality & knowledge on servicing customers is beyond 5 star. Thankyou for an unforgettable holiday experience in Singapore",10,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I donât know how this hotel is rated 5 star , we arrived at 11 pm and no one came to pick our luggage from the taxi we were ok fine then they gave us a twin room smaller than the one we already booked and paid for because there was the big one was not available and they will move us to the bigger room in the morning and this without a compensation , Then the worst thing which is the room itself just have a look at the pics and you be the judge , i would never book this hotel to any one its like paying for 5 star hotel and getting 3 star experience .",2,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"My family and I stayed for a few nights during the September school holidays and had a brief, but lovely respite from work. Weâll like to credit the people who made that possible.   Foremost, we want to thank Kenneth for his exceptional service. He arranged meticulously for detailed room tours before the stay, the most hassle-free check-in and out, room upgrade as well as dining reservations. I have to say he met our needs and wants very well, a testament to his keen observation of our preferences. Thereâs more to thank him for but I think it suffices to say: we are impressed by his understated excellence and with him, we always feel that weâre in good hands.   The service and offerings at the Club Lounge was the highlight of the stay. Not only was the view most inviting, butâ¦",10,Sep-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We had three nights at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel. It was a delight to stay there - highly professional staff, great breakfast buffet in the Food Capital restaurant and very comfortable bed and pillows for a restful stop over.    The staff are super responsive to any queries you may have and are professional, warm and welcoming.  I'd especially like to mention Jennifer and Kenneth, the hosts in the Club Lounge who go over and above to help you enjoy your stay.   The Hotel is right on the river and there's plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes within easy walking distance to enjoy riverside dining, if you fancy going out.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,really don't know what else you want me to say- we did not end up staying with you as when we originally booked last year during Covid the pricing was great- then had to cancel. Rebooked and all of a sudden prices where double because travelling had lifted. Not impressed - could not afford to pay double. would have liked to have stayed with you but ended up elsewhere at more reasonable price,2,Aug-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We always loved staying at the hotel as we were always welcome by the staff - concierge team to club lounge team. However, during our recent short stay earlier this month, it has left us a sour feeling. We are prestige member of my millennium and we were being upgraded to club deluxe room (courtesy of club manager Ms S). Things took a downward spiral fast shortly after checking in. We went to the club lounge for some light refreshment drinks and upon stepping out from the lift, Ms J, asked ""how can I help you"". Whereas Ms S, ""welcome in"". (2 different treatments, we let it slide as it wasn't a big deal).  Now on checking out, this is where it all begin.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Trip advisor   The staff (Kenneth, Shirley and Jennifer) at the Club Room are always very polite, friendly, professional and extremely accommodating. Everyday the staff welcome us with a smile and provide an excellent service that includes a range of delicious hors dâoeuvre and drinks. Our stay at the hotel was to celebrate my wifeâs dads 80th birthday with family from England and Australia. On the day of his birthday the pastry chef (Jason) made an amazing cake for him and everyone to enjoy which was appreciated by all. The food and service is always first class - thank you and we look forward to returning to the hotel and the Club Room soon",10,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Very bad hotel! It was dirty with very bad service and very old rooms! The only good was the breakfast which you can find a lot of things. At 8:30 the cleaning room service rung our bell and wake us up beside we had a âdo not disturbâ. At the check in they have 2 reservations (2rooms) beside 1. The furniture in the room was very old and dirty and the mattress had something that was really disgusting! You can check the photos,4,Sep-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Hotel is catering mostly to group tours. It's really not geared to the independent traveler. The location is good but food and beverage facilities are limited. The lobby feels like a railway station with lots of group tour guests running around and there is no feeling of being in a pleasant and classy hotel lobby.,6,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Outstanding service! Shirley (The Club Manager) was really friendly to us and even offered drinks for us to try! I felt really comfortable dining in here. Definitely a thumbs up! Will recommend this!!,10,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Over all it was good experience, their service is responsive and location is superb, but I think itâs time the hotel management spend some money in renovating rooms and electric fitments and try to make rooms more plush and rich ",8,Sep-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I have stayed here for almost 2 weeks and I must say that I have enjoyed my stay because of their amazing customer service to their guest. The Filipino concierge named  Paul is always accommodating and kind especially the bartenders Sandy Castillo, Karlo Torres, Yuslizan,Manor, Brian and to their managers Sivan and the  rest. They have provided us first class customer service and making us feel at home. They are professional, friendly and nice service crew .. they never make you feel that you are asking too much. friendly Service crew like them makes your trip extra pleasant .Thank you guys.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is also near the major places like Ion orchard, wisma, Clarke Quay etc and if I will travel to Singapore again I will deffo stay in this hotelâ¦",10,Aug-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Whilst the hotel staff were pleasant enough and the foyer was fresh, the rooms are in need of updating. This is not to the standard of a 5 star hotel. The room was dark and a little dingy, the carpet faded and obvious patches to the wallpaper that looked amateurish. The airconditioner rattled (mentioned but not actioned) and the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor (again mentioned with a fix applied that did not resolve the problem).  The pool is fantastic along with the gym. Breakfast is a crowded affair but with quite a range of food items. At present, there is a 1.5km walk to the nearest MRT station but one is being built across the road.  If the rooms were renovated, I would return but I can just say I was disappointed with the deluxe room I booked.",6,Jul-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Quite a number of areas to improve on, perhaps too lengthy to mention here. Maybe this hotel is more for business stays. I stayed with my family of 7 and i didn't find it very family friendly especially for children. ",6,Jun-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We were concerned the room might be too small for 5 kids, but Ari's gracious hospitality made the staycation a truly memorable one.  A most enjoyable buffet dinner, together with delightful walks alongside the Singapore river as the family explored this part of Singapore!  Food Capitol's staff - Sally & Zangmo, made our dining experience a joy with their friendly smiles & surprise welcome drink for the kids! It takes so little to delight the little ones.  There was a chess tournament in one of the convention rooms which engaged our family of avid chess players. Thoroughly enjoyed our 2nights here.. highly recommended!",10,Jun-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Book this hotel and you will experience what meanness, rudeness, unfriendliness and uncultured behaviour is. From the check-in reception staff to the staff in the breakfast lobby, everyone behaves as they operate some government department where one expects straightforward answers. In India and in a Tier-1 travel city such as Udaipur, Jaipur etc., I would not pay even 5000 INR per day for the room that I was given in Singapore for over 12000 INR per day. The smallest I have stayed so far. I have had my fair share of travel to Europe, Dubai, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. My wife has additionally traveled to Hong Kong and she too was thoroughly disappointed. 2/4 days, our toiletries were not replaced. Linen was changed only once in 4 days. Water bottles had to be brought sometimes fromâ¦",2,Jun-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We went in with lot of expectations. But, the Attitude of the staff and Food quality is the biggest turn off. Staff is rude and not friendly.  Food quality, especially Indian food is terrible at buffet and IN room dining also.   ",4,Jun-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Rooms were reasonably price. Location to MRT not convenient. Cleanliness of bathrooms poor. Hotel staff not friendly except Verone at the Check in counter was helpful. Staff at the restaurant not friendly except the foreign worker from Busan, can't remember the name. Too many people at breakfast makes it impossible to get at table especially when you are there for a business trip and need to rush for meetings",4,Jun-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I felt that being a 5 star hotel, I did not get the wow factor of being in a 5 star hotel.  For a start, the connecting rooms were not opened despite earlier request during reservations for connecting room(thought this was intuitive as I never encountered this issue with other hotels).  There were quite a few faulty items in either rooms - thermostat not working/ spoilt bathroom fixtures.   Overall bed quality and standard of housekeeping were good. The staff also were very hospitable, polite and efficient.   Would recommend this hotel if you were looking for only to have a place to sleep, but not indulge. ",6,Mar-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Due to Covid 19, we had a staycation locally instead of travelling overseas with many restrictions. Though some reviews and photographs of hotel were negative, we gave this under rated 5 star hotel a try and was pleasantly surprised.

Shall visit again definitely. Thank you Grand Copthrone Waterfront Hotel.",10,Mar-22,

Jennifer our host at the club lounge did a wonderful job with fantastic hospitality with a welcoming and delightful personality serving beverages of your choice accompanied by well thought out three course hors dâoeuvres which were tasty and innovative.  From checking in, to the highly accommodating  concierge service  was delightful and wonderful in getting back to full service for  a major hotel in Singapore.

Extra added value for me, since I am a biologist, the otters swam down the river every morning.  The Grand Copthorne will be our new home whenever we are in Singapore.",10,Mar-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Staff all excellent but quality of the hotel not great.  Room spacious but basic and furniture damaged / worn.  Needed painting.  Very clean though.  Food area more like a canteen than 5* - bar reminded me of airport bar - not very welcoming and small.  Room service very limited in choice of food and liguid eggs used for breakfast!  Executive Lounge very nice and work it for the drinks / food served free of charge for 2hrs in the evening - great views from the 29th lounge floor.,6,Mar-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Reading some of the other reviews, we were initially a bit concerned about what our experience will be like here, but I can safely say this was one of the best stays at any place across the world.   First part of our stay was in the executive suite, which is very spacious, comes with services like free laundry (2pc/ day), and executive lounge privileges. Alex, Megan & Lynn ensured we felt comfortable, looked after and attended to in the lounge as we took most of our work calls there during the day. Ms Shirley ( loved the drink they have named after her), is a kind fabulous lady, who ensures things run smoothly for all present on the floor.

The pool was really enjoyable with deck chairs which was a nice way to cool off after being out all day in the the heat of the city! For Singapore standards the room was very spacious and the bathroom was so impressive with a lovely powerful shower and a large bath. The rooms have big floor to ceiling windows providing a great view to the city. The location was excellent, you can easily walk from the hotel to Clarke Quay by simply following the river.

Kudos to Danny & Shirley for making us felt at home with excellent service and serving us with varieties of alcoholic/non-alcoholic cocktails and juices. Also made it a point to explain the food served (cold dish, hot dish, and dessert).  Pity that the Club Lounge is only open from the afternoon, as the breakfast at level one was heavily packed and the staff there were simply overwhelmed, with exhausted and disgruntled expression. Hence we only had bfast there once, the following day we had ours at Great World City instead,  which is just a 8min walk from the hotel.

One staff mentioned it was because it was Ala carte, another mentioned it was because of the chef, and the third mentioned it was because there was a lot of orders to handle. Was quite unhappy with the discrepancies but at least they tried to remedy it by providing complimentary dessert. Got to checked in but when we finally went up, workers were at the room we were assigned to fixing a hinge at the door.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is a shadow of its former self: Pros: 1. Central location & an awesome location 2. Large rooms 3. Seemed like a large breakfast spread, though i never ate..  Cons: 1. Very poorly maintained. Despite housekeeping's intervention, the ac wouldn't cool the room - just barely. No matter how low you set it. 2. Too noisy. The opening and closing of doors kept me awake - the corridor amplifies the noise. 3. Understaffed totally - during check out, i was 8th in the line, and only 1 counter open.. and despite a repeated reminder.. it remained 1 counter.. The understaffing shows on the service - even the front office staff is grumpy.. 4. Bad service - still waiting for my bill via email, despite reassurances tnat it will happen by noon. 5.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Booked for 5 nights (29th june - 4th july), still staying in this worst hotel ever. Very arrogant and rude staff as if we are staying here for free.  They seriously need to learn the meaning of hospitality, every staff member is very arrogant and mannerless.  Rooms are also in a very old state not maintained well, in room dinning sucks big time.  Wont recommend this property to anyone! STAY AWAY!",2,Jul-22,

Karlos in the bar did fantastic and made the evenings relaxing with great drinks.  Overall the stay was great. Rooms were kept up and cleaned every night. Next trip will definitely be back.  Great job guys!",10,Jun-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Shirley is very attentive and proactive in assessing our needs, which is greatly appreciated and a nice departure  from the front desk on the ground floor. She gave us a 3 hours extension to the check out  further to the 1 hour extension  given by front desk, which is greatly appreciated.

Had to call for towels , fresh set of glasess( we were told to wash ourselves), carpet - as dirty as it can be .  Basically no housekeeping.  Also room sizes are way too small .

TV screen size not big and all channels picture quality is poor and snowy. ",6,Jun-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Checked in today and hugely disappointed. We were of course aware that this is not a 5-star hotel and did not have high expectations to begin with, but what we encountered was just appalling.   It is our standard practice to sanitize and do a wipe-down whenever we check into any hotel, even pre-covid. Other than the obvious table surfaces, we were disgusted to find how dirty and dusty the other surfaces were (refer to attached photo) - including the leather headboard of the bed, shelves, chairs, handles, etc.   And then there is the apparent lack of resources (or simply a case of the hotel subbing out services to the cheapest service providers?). There was only ONE bath towel in the bathroom (we paid for 3 persons) and we had to call housekeeping twice before someone came withâ¦",4,Jun-22,

Lobby area has artistic design and nice space and aesthetics for photo-taking and to unwind for drinks. Staff are friendly, but check in was a bit slow.  Bathroom area is nice and looks newly renovated, nicer than the room itself.  The only eyesore is the old tv with bad screen and sound. Probably need to replace that as it looks it is going to die out soon. Didnât go well with the nice decor of the whole hotel.",8,Mar-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Completely scam is this hotel, avoid it at all cost. Over changed for 400 dollars for one way transfer from airport to the hotel which was quoted 100 dollars on the phone.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights and visited the executive club for both nights. The Club Manager, Shirley and Club Executives, Danny and Kenneth had been making my family felt welcomed during our visits. As it was a Saturday and the rehearsal for National Day had just commenced, Danny even alerted us when the helicopter holding the National Flag flew past the window, so that we did not miss the amazing close-up view.  They always came back to check on us and ensure we have enough food and drinks.  Thank you to Danny, Kenneth and Shirley for spicing up our visit.",8,Jun-22,

When we came requested at reception we had a full night flight please try they are so rude saying don't request here we can't do anything.  2 - Room - We entered the room there was dust everywhere, the bathroom shower was used and there was hair all over near drainage.  3 - Breakfast - Never had worst breakfast than this in any hotels.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Initially got upgraded to Executive floor suite. Old but large room and executive floor snacks and drinks were great between 6-8pm. Breakfast too busy and not an awful lot of choice so went once and didn't bother again. Overall nice hotel in good location but work needs to be done on breakfast. ,8,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Located right on the river with a footbridge over to a great range of bars and restaurants. Even walked to Chinatown from there. Great value with buffet breakfast included.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"It's an older style hotel with very good facilities and a really good location. My husband and I stayed for 9 nights in a club room on the 30th floor, which in our opinion is well worth the addition spend. The staff throughout the hotel are very accommodating but the staff at the Executive lounge are especially so, in particular Shirley, Jennifer, Kenneth and Megan could not do enough to ensure we had a great stay. Breakfast in served downstairs at the buffet restaurant which can be a little crowded at times, however, the food is always varied and of good quality.

The staff were very friendly and professional. The food was good. Overall, the hotel and our room felt a bit tired and in need of an upgrade. I would have thought that they could have taken advantage of the last 2 years downtime to do some works, but it seems that nothing was done. If you're looking for a reasonable hotel in a good location, the Grand Copthorne is a fair choice.",8,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Did stay a bit longer. High floor and with a view down to marina bay sands. Walking down the flod is perfect!  Most staff very nice and did try their best.  The hair and spa in the hotel is absolutely great!  You donât need to go anywhere else, both massage, hair blow, haircut and keratine treatment was great. No rush and you are very well taken cared of.  Easy to order foodpanda or whatever you want if you want in dining.  Safe place and no smell of mold.  I would stay here again if I ever come back!  The pool and gym is a bit worn down. But itâs ok.  Breakfast is not for me since Iâm Scandinavian and very picky, but it looked fairly fresh.",8,Feb-22,

This is what genuine service from the heart looks like, great job and keep it up, Halim ðð As for the hotel, the basic facilities are quite antiquated but sufficient, so for the price in the $200s it is satisfactory for us.

Fourth, ridiculous long queue for breakfast on Saturday morning, staff is slow in clearing the tables when guests have finished their meals. Did not manage to get a table even at 1030am and have to forfeit the breakfast as was told to check out at 11am and no late check out was even provided for such situation.

And, don't expect verbal explanations of hotel services and amenities--you will get a sheet of paper with QR codes.  The rooms are very basic, but large, large enough that they could add more (and need to add more) furniture.  Restaurant is nice; but service is very slow.",6,Jun-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Our stay was for 10 days 9 nights.  Initially our first room was very small for 3 adults. Once we spoke to Shirley, the Club Manager she went above and beyond to keep us happy.  We got a bigger room, amazing views of the city and very comfortable for our stay.  Yes we did pay slightly more but it was well worth the extra dollars. The Club Lounge staff we had the pleasure of meeting and looking after us were Shirley, Jennifer, Kenneth, Megan and not forgetting the truly amazing  Danny.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"In this 5 Star hotel which was named Best Luxury Hotel not too long ago, I am quite appalled that the 2 major aspects of hospitality are lacking in this hotel.  1) Housekeeping  We were long-term guests in this hotel. We stayed for 10 nights on different levels. With what we paid, I believe we have become VIP guests. However, on the 1st week, we stayed in Deluxe Waterfront at 16th floor, housekeeping was terrible.  In my experience, never hire men from Chinese mainland for Housekeeping roles as they have no detail to attention or cleanliness and no aesthetic sense in keeping the room nice and clean. When staying on 16th floor, the beds were made like as if I was living in a prison. It was not hotel standard and not perfectly clean. The towel for feet we left on the toilet floorâ¦",6,May-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,The first room we were given was so filthy that they changed us to a new room after we strongly complained.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"To get the negativity out of the way first, the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel has got quite tired in their rooms but still very comfortable. The TV sets definitely require new ones to be placed in all the rooms if ours was anything to go by as the sound was terrible and picture was as bad. The positives outweigh the negatives because the food was good and the canapÃ©s in the Club Lounge were a delight.  Beds were very comfortable especially the pillows and rooms were lovely and clean.  Views from our room were spectacular looking out to the river and Marina Bay.

We truly appreciated the warm and personable service provided by Shirley, Club Manager and Danny,  Club Executive, who were both very attentive & consistently diligent and efficient while maintaining a very calm and assuring disposition. With business picking up, space maybe a constraint and it may become a challenge to service a larger group of guests.   The Food Capital cafe could not cater to the large breakfast crowd so there maybe a need for either having different seatings, or to provide more seating perhaps in another room (like some hotels which open up other function rooms).  There is a need for the services of porters.",8,Apr-22,

We were clueless about alcoholic cocktail drinks but Ms. Shirley, recommended and concocted well refreshing drinks to us. Both herself and Ms. Jennifer explained every of the dishes served to us on our 2 night stay in addition to offering us extra. Ms. Shirley even helped us to extend our check out the next day. We will to grateful to her. We highly recommend this hotel to all.ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",10,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We had a really good time here while also having a birthday celebration. At the executive club lounge, both Shirley and Jennifer were very proactive and forthcoming to us. We truly enjoyed the time most at this lounge as good food and drinks were given. Even when we were not sure of what drinks to drink, Shirley was kind enough to recommend and mix drinks that suited all our palettes. I highly recommend coming here if you are planning to stay at Grand Copthorne Waterfront.",10,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Our stay at Grand Copthrone Waterfront was pleasant and great. One thing that stood out was the service at the Executive Club from Shirley and Jennifer during Tea and Happy Hour. We were also well fed because of them. Thanks so much!,10,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Hotel is nice and staff is friendly.   Especially at the executive club lounge. Been there during the evening cocktail period. The view is breathtaking, on top of the good service provided by Ms Shirley Chng and Ms Jennifer.   Upon entry, we were introduced with what cocktail is available and prepare it for us ð. After which, we are served with small appetisers, main course and dessert. Even though it does not look much, but it is very filling (we had to skip dinner after).  Kudos to GCW Executive Club Lounge! ððð",10,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,First I would like to commend Jennifer. Jennifer from the club lounge was exceptional in her service. From the first day of checking into the hotel. She remembers my wife and me and attended to our needs promptly. She introduced every dish that was served during the course and constantly checked in with us if we are doing fine and if we needed more drinks. Definitely will return in the future if it permits. Well done Grand Copthorne  Waterfront Hotel Singapore!,10,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"The nearest mrt station is Fort canning, but it take more than 15min. Itâs humid outside and sometimes rain so hard, quite tough for travelers to reach the station.  However itâs so nice street along the river. ",8,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Room is very clean. My package comes with Club benefits. Shirley (Club Manager) & her team took care of us well whenever we're at the club. She even arranged a birthday cake when I told her we're actually celebrating a birthday. Pleasant surprise & an awesome staycation.,8,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"I stayed here 3 nights with my family. This old hotel has a renovated, new-ish look in the lobby, but the room itself is still very old. Service here was rude. The entire breakfast service was under staffed and guests were being shouted at instead of being served; room wasnât properly cleaned - possibly the worst stay in Singapore!",4,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Room was spacious and good for friends stay since we were three and had our own beds. The room AC was quite weak and could not keep the room cool in the afternoon and staffs responsiveness to requests was quite poor.,4,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Wonderful experience from check in to final night. All the staff were very friendly and super efficient. Shirley, Jennifer, Danny and Alex in the executive club were just superb and looked after us so brilliantly. The food and drinks on offer were great and they have created such a nice environment. Our room in the 30th floor was huge and had a great view of the river. Huge bathroom with big tub and separate shower. Breakfast was very nice and again all the staff in the restaurant were great. Highly recommend staying here if you want proper big hotel luxury. ",10,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Pathetic unfriendly and rude behaviour of staff. No efforts made bu anyone to make sure customer is satisfied in any front possible. The overall objective of the staff to make sure either they make more money or just do the no of hours to complete there shift and go home. To state an experience on my fourth day it took me 20 mins and asking 4 different people for a water bottle near the breakfast area as I had to take some medicine but they were all just not bothered about me at all. I will make sure that everyone I know never ever visit your hotel and hAve such a bad experience. ,2,Apr-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We stayed for 3days, 2nights. Firstly, I commend the fast check in we had. It took only a few minutes for us to get in. Our room is just ok for us too. Itâs huge actually. Secondly, the executive lounge service is perfect. They donât let our table be emptied of food and drinks which we liked. Lol! Megan, let us try the blended drinks, shirley ginger and sea breeze for our final night. Sheâs very accommodating, they all are. Thirdly, the breakfast buffet is awesome. The pool is great. Theyâd consider those who are 5ft below in height! Lol! I just found the toilet kinda weird cos no bidet. But overall, i paid so worth it for this staycation. 5/5 dude!",10,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,From the time we walked in the door we where welcomed the staff helped use with every question about the places we booked to see and gave advice on the best times and other attraction we might like to see. The hotel is in walking to place China town and a lot of food eateries in the area. Out back is the river which has a good walking link to parts of the main city and is very clean.  ,10,Apr-22,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We stayed at Grand Copthrone Waterfront for 5 nights in the Deluxe Waterfront Room.  The view from room was amazing overlooking the river and partial view of Marina Bay Sands.  The disappointing things were :- Front Desk staff not at all friendly and never ever even tried to understand our request. It was my son's birthday so when we checked in at that time too I had informed the hotel about the same. Later just one day before too I approached the front desk and requested them to arrange some ballons and a cake for celebrating his birthday (important thing is I told them to charge for all this not do it for free), still nothing was done when we returned to the hotel.   I literally had to fight to get a small pastry from them as they kept on refusing by giving excuses of closingâ¦",6,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Upon checking in at the appointed 3PM we were told that the room was available only at 3:30PM.  After protestation, a room magically appears from the unsmiling staff.  If you like neat tricks, this is your hotel. Otherwise the stay was uneventful.",6,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Booked Club Deluxe Room which comes with club benefits. Overall, we liked our stay (mainly for view and club) but didnât feel luxury or welcomed by some staff, which is the main reason I probably would not return.  Positive:The room is quite big and the view is really pretty (ensure to request for river/marina view)! Room is clean and comfortable. The pool and Jacuzzi temperature was nice to use. Buffet Breakfast was served at the lobby, and was delicious but not wide variety or luxury items. Club lounge was relaxing, food quality was good (but limited variety and again not luxury item). The lounge staff (Shirley and Jennifer) were always attentive. Especially Shirley goes beyond with drink recommendations and helped to extend our check-out. Ensure to try her recommendations! â¦",8,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Excellent Front office staff Halim and Verona are great and cheerful! Also had a free upgrade with bathtub from Halim! Thanks for offering the late checkout for my solo staycation.  Cons - bathtub looks moldy from the side and dusty. Water pressure good. However the tissue box is broken and wall need painting and lights are not working well. Ordered room service mushroom soup, and it arrived 75 mins later. On top of it, it tasted bland and tasteless.",6,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,The rooms are horrible. We were group of 8 families. The staff was so rude. No service at all. No sense of hospitality. Rooms are so run down and so carpets are so smelly. Not recommended at all. Not worth the money they are charging. We had booked all categories of room. Even suites were just horrible. Breakfast also very less options for vegetarians. Still staying in the room while giving this review.,2,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"5 star hotel, 3.5 star experience. Booked and stayed in the club room with club access with late checkout at 3pm as per our Trip.com booking. But we were surprised to find that due to the pandemic late check out was subjected to availability and that the club access only operates from 1pm to 10pm with all day refreshment. During the day from 1pm to 6pm there is all day non-alcoholic refreshments with cookies only. Tapas style meals are only available from 6 to 8pm daily with menu changes daily. There is no booking available for the club lounge! First come first serve style!!! Remember to head there early to get a seat else you will be turned away from your entitlement. Breakfast the next day was held at the main lobby Resturant which the staff was abit rude to guest waiting inâ¦",4,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,We enjoyed the excellent services from the friendly staff at the bar counter. Had an awesome birthday celebrations and enjoyed the good foods and drinks with my family members over the long weekend. Thanks for your excellent services provided. ,8,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"great location , but very poor service attitude , small rooms , no restaurant capacity in coffee shop & hence missed breakfast , had to ask for housekeeping service , lobby bar is poor .   This hotel is for Groups & not for business travellers . ",6,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"The hotel room is dim, bed is not firm and aircon is not functioning well. Middle of the night the room was warm and then cold again. I think the thermostat is not functioning as it should. Location wise is not bad, near to Great World shopping mall and Tiong Bahru market. The breakfast was mediocre. ",6,May-22,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"We had booked a waterfront deluxe room for 4 nights. But the AC in room was not working properly. It was too cold. After maintenance guy came it got too hot. Again we had to call them at midnight to change it back to as it was.  Lighting in room is very dull. Need more lighting and bright lights in rooms please. We had to switch on our flash lights at night if we needed to search something from bags.  Waiting for the breakfast was UNBELIEVABLE. we had to wait for 30 mins in line just to get a table at breakfast. We had 2 kids, 2.5 years and 4 month old. If we had been with any tour we would have had to miss the breakfast for sure.  Food was good. Service was good. But the property is not maintained as a 5 star level category.",6,Apr-22,

The pool bar was closed but there was a phone where you could order food and drinks.  Apparently there is a roof garden and an herb garden on the 9th and 10th floors but our key wouldn't let us up there. The breakfast buffet was good.

Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean),"Grand Park City Hall - You were incredible! We came to Singapore for the first time for our first anniversary and they were incredibly kind and accommodating. I had contacted them ahead of time to ask some questions and they got back to me quickly. 
The room was in great conditioned and I actually loved using the app. The staff was amazing and always quick to respond. The location is perfect since it's central to almost everything. 
We were there for our anniversary and they sent us a few fun gifts to celebrate. If you stay more than 7 days they also offer complimentary laundry for 2 items per day. 
I can't say enough about this hotel - we were extremely happy with our choice and would definitely stay again. ",10,11-Sep-19,
Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean),Very good location for tourists and business trips. Control of the room is from your smart device which is good but can be frustrating when you just want to flick on a light quickly in the night.

Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean),"Good location for business as well pleasure.  Well appointed and clean room. Hi tech in room Light and Temp Control. 

Appears all Amenities not fully operative after the renovation. Lifts are one corner after walking a long corridor.  Hope there are lifts in a second location as well which should be open soon.

Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean),"To start the positive; the hotel is in an excellent location as it is in the heart of the city and within minutes from a metro station, and the rooms are luxurious and clean. But there are few things that I did not particularly like: the first is the fact that this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel; this is not very obvious as it lacks a lot of typical 5 star hotel amenities. The second thing that I did not like is the touch screen switches; this feature is very annoying and time consuming, and the app requires you to register before using it which is not convenient at all.",8,2-Oct-19,

Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean),Grand Park City Hall is not the hotel it used to be.. Check in takes ages.. At check in you have to deal with the breakfast crowd. Trying to get past people who are checking in.. While trying to get into breakfast you have to navigate people getting their breakfast. Trying to get out of breakfast is the same as trying to get to a table coming in.Then you have to deal with the people checking in again.LEVEL 3 IS A NIGHTMARE.,6,24-Oct-19,

Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean),"Love the technology used but sometimes it can be a bit troublesome esp the in room control. The control in the room is a bit laggy and to login through phone just to switch off the lights is rather troublesome.

Housekeeping was poor! It seems like the hotel is understaff. We were here for 4 days and never got our room cleaned once. We have to call to restock amenities and to empty bins.

I got a full breakfast each morning, cocktails each evening, and a lot of snacks each night that filled me up for dinner.

The in house dining for dinner was absolutely brilliant in service, quality of food  and well priced. The maitre d, was attentive and went that extra mile.

The same restaurant for breakfast was an utter disappointment. The ordered meals took so long to arrive. The hot drinks  were slow in arriving and luke warm when delivered. It would be the only five star hotel to serve English breakfast tea cold in a mug consistently over five mornings. The staff with headphones taking orders need to pay attention to ensure the orders are delivered to the table in a reasonable time. 

Over all the Hotel was brilliantl, well priced, excellently staffed (except for breakfast), the rooms are clean and modern, the location is great and the staff at the door on level one are very helpful.

Also, 2 of the 3 elevators are shut off in the evening to save costs.  huge disaster during busy times.  Rooms are unreasonably small in size - a bed fits, no closet space.

Called the housekeeping a few times but there was no response, so we just let it slide. 

We booked the Loft room and was pleasantly surprised how clean and cozy it was despite it being small. for a couple on staycation, it's fine. but for those with luggages, i think it'll be hard to manoeuvre. The bathroom reek of musty smell, it was really pungent and bad that we had to hold our breaths everytime we step into the bathroom. Read that this was an issue on other reviews so i really hope the bathroom can be cleaned more thoroughly, preferably with clean cloths. Once again tried to call housekeeping but to no avail, it was about 3pm. 

Nothing to shout about for the lounge, food was mediocre, we just enjoyed the peace (because perpetually nobody at the lounge) and tea. Breakfast was normal, nothing fantastic. the tables were not cleaned so we had to clean ourselves (I'm pregnant). No service at all.

The staff at the front desk are not that friendly or professional, except for the manager, Geraldine.  She is good.

The rooms are really small and I did not know we were going to have a double bed.  The bed was too small for my husband, that his feet were sticking out.  It was ok for me but he was not happy and did not sleep well.  It was a club room too so expected a bigger room.

The club lounge was very nice.  Lovely food and the staff there were great.

The gym was not available, for some reason whilst we were there.

The breakfast downstairs was nice.  Maybe a little more western food as it catered a lot of Indian food.

The cleanliness of the room was good, but there was one day we had to wait for our room to be cleaned after being out all day.  It was about 3pm and still not ready, so we had to go out again for it to be cleaned, when all we wanted to do, after walking a lot was to come to our room and rest on our bed in our clean made up room.

Tv quality was poor and hotel information was only found on the tv slideshow rather than on a booklet. No hairdryer until we called reception and had to wait about 20mins to get one. Hairdryer is of super poor quality. Room so small that 1 person can only walk around at 1 time. If you are not Asian it would be quite cramp for 2 ppl.

Hotel Boss,"We knew our staycation started in the right track when we stepped into this hotel. We stayed at the premium queen balcony room. This is our 3rd time staying in your wonderful establishment. All our stays has been very satisfying and extremely pleasant. Your staff with their high attentiveness and diligence have been simply outstanding. Special mention to Duty Manager Ryan for his attention to details and his proactiveness to always go out of his way to make us feel welcome and at home. Exhibited diligence, dedication and commitment.  Not forgetting all his front office staff who were equally outstanding and dedicated. Needless to say, housekeeping was equally prompt with their service. Rooms were always well and neatly maintained.  Pool area was excellent. Well maintained, huge,â¦",10,Oct-20,
Hotel Boss,I enjoyed my staycation here. The hotel is exceptionally clean and the location is perfect as there are nearby eateries. I would like to compliment the front staff at the counter by the name of Ivy as she had made my stay here a good one. We requested for an upgrade of room and she went the extra mile to try to accommodate to our needs and request. She was also very polite and cheerful. I would like the management to recognise her good service. Overall 9.5 out of 10 for the hotel.,10,Sep-20,
Hotel Boss,"Booked with Hotel Boss for a staycation in the month of October via Agoda. We were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking, nor informed upon checking in. The purpose of opening up staycation package post COVID19 clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities. Else, are we suppose to just rot in the room? Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area. Closing the facilities due to COVID19 measures shouldn't be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users. Avoiding essential information on the booking page is a form of misrepresentation. Good luck to you.",2,Oct-20,
Hotel Boss,"No doubt that the location of the hotel is accessible. 200m away from the train station and buses  available a step away from the hotel entrance.  It is easy to get food and there is tons of options.to get food delivery around the area.   Room is pretty small but suffice for a night rest away from hotel and work destress.   However, checking in was horrendous.  I am appalled by the service that were given by the concierge service.  Zero empathy.   This is how the checking in was like :   Front Desk : What can I help you with?  Me : Hi good afternoon to you, I will like to check in please FD :  Do you make booking?  Me : Yes, this is my booking itinerary and heres my identification  Me : If its possible can I request for a room with balcony if available FD : Yes, 20$ extra.  Me :â¦",2,Oct-20,
Hotel Boss,"I've stayed at Hotel Boss several times before and so far I have enjoyed my stays. This time around I've decided once more to try a 2 nights retreat to recharge and relax away from my rented place. This hotel is also memorable for me since it is one of my go to hotels  to book whenever I have loved ones visiting. Firstly, the price is right on the spot for a 4 star hotel which is not too expensive. I booked their promo for 2 nights which costs me only 188 SGD including tax. Secondly, I personally loved their lobby with the big grand chandelier but I missed the Gloria Jean's coffee right inside it. Their restaurant at the lobby is also closed.

Upon entering the room, Faizal even called up to our room to check on whether weâre ok & comfortable with the room given. We mentioned some tv issues & in less than 30mins he was up in our room to check & help us solve the issue.   Iâd give his service a beyond exceptionally 5 stars service!

The room had a window which was as good as nothing. Anyways- my review will not be based on the roomâs size as itâs a common trend in most of the hotels in Singapore. These kind of hotels are good to come back to only sleep, after having spent most of the day exploring the city.  Room- apart from the description above the room had paper thin walls. You would be comfortable to use the bathroom only if you know your room-mate well! The bathroom was surprisingly spacious enough to do your morning duties and have a shower too.

Stayed for 3 nights but got serviced for changing bedsheets and towel on 2nd night which was fine, though found one of the replaced towels stained and the maid did not even bother replacing a used coffee cup that was left on the table.  Surprised that room was a bit smaller than expected as seen in the photos. But it was fine for just one person. There is a money exchange and nice restaurant right next to the hotel, a mall just next to the MRT so quite convenient in terms of food so breakfast at the hotel is unnecesary. ",8,Jul-22,
Hotel Boss,Poor hotel I will term it as Sarai. No room service rooms cleaned after alternate days lots of rush ton s of people like a hostel. When you call front desk they say shortage of staff rooms are too small  bathroom are too small just like a public bathroom . Although public bathrooms are much better . No jet in toilets  . One thing good close to Indian restaurants that is why deserves one star some booking sites are predicting 4star but I will rate it as Sarai  . Better to spent some more money and opt for better hotel.  After placing beds in room not a inch place left for moving. Worst ever hotel I have visited on abroad from india.room size 10*8.  Bathroom 5*5. So don't ever visit this public charitable Sarai  and spent little bit bit of money for good hotel . So again no roomâ¦,2,Jul-22,
Hotel Boss,"Pros:  - Location  Cons:  - Breakfast did not have almost any options for continental breakfast. At first, we were even inserted in a halal breakfast. We only had cereal to eat... we talked with the reception and we were moved to a supposedly more continental breakfast which had almost the same options... all the provided food was for asian breakfast. Considering this is a 4 star hotel, we were expecting more as we were paying 12 dollars per breakfast per person.  - the room was small and we could hear everything happening in the next room and hallways...  - our room was only cleaned once in three days which is not acceptable in a 4 star hotel  - the amenities of the room were only replaced for one person.",4,Jul-22,

Hotel Boss,"Room was quite small, but clean and well equipped. Overall great stay, staff was extremely nice and helpful. Singapore is an expensive destination compared to a lot of other countries and people should have realistic expectations - a decent hotel in Singapore, in a great location, with good or decent service and expect to pay 2cents? The cleaning service happens every other day for sustainability reasons, Wi-Fi works just fine.",8,Jun-22,
Hotel Boss,"We stayed there for 2 days. Size of the room is so small that you will have to think twice, about where to unpack your bags. No cupboards, no press, no sleepers. and mind it, it is q 4 STAR hotel. On the first day, when we came back to the room in the evening, the room was not cleaned at all, even the bed and the bathroom was not cleaned. On asking, they told that we clean it every alternate day. When asked to get the clean cups for the room, the manager told us to wash the cups in the room and use it again. Never had such ugly experience in a 4 star hotel. I will request people never to book this hotel if you are staying for 2 days and are expecting a clean room during your stay. Pathetic experience, the hotel should go through a services audit.",2,Aug-22,

Hotel Boss,I was frustrated with hotel staffs and the noise when I first checked in. Keith Manager who works in the evening is beyond wonderful. I found other managers who work in the morning are some what not that nice to the guests. I asked for same assistance in terms of room complaint or noise complaint and they werenât that helpful. Keith is the ONLY one who took his time and showed me 3 other rooms for me to choose due to noise issues with other guests. Thanks to Keith Iâm able to sleep so peacefully. Keith also helped me with updating Singtel SIM card so kindly. I couldnât appreciate him more. I would definitely come back to this hotel because of Keith. Thank you Keith for making my stay so much better!!!,8,Jul-22,
Hotel Boss,My husband and I stayed at Hotel Boss for three nights. The check in process was very quick and staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and they give you a towel and some shower amendments such as body wash and shampoo. If you want your towels changing you need to inform reception. The room was very small. The pool area was clean and had a nice view of the city. The gym was small and busy so was hard to get onto the machines.  The hotel is around 10 minutes walk from Haji Lane which is a nice area to drink and eat. The hotel will order you a taxi if needed. A taxi from the hotel is about 30 Singapore dollars. The underground is a short 10 minute walk and very easy to use! We would recommend you using this to get to the main attractions like Gardens by the Bayâ¦,10,Aug-22,

Our room was on the 15th floor we had a beautiful view of the city however the room was small and not furnished like their website photos, so be prepared. The room consisted of a double and single bed. The room has a safe, hairdryer and tea & coffee making facilities. The bathroom is compact and the shower was powerful enough.

Worst property.,2,Aug-22,

No wardrobe provided, but instead, they built some sort of clothes rail above the desk (next to the mounted TV). Tea and coffee were provided, but it wasn't the branded ones like nescafe/lipton.  What shocked me was they only schedule room cleaning every other day. This means you will see trash bins along the corridors.

Ironing facilities are provided in a separate place.  The only reason why Iâm deducting one star is the room size - if you come with large luggages, as people normally do when travelling Asia, you might want to consider a much bigger than their standard room which will cost more I imagine.

I like that there's smart tv in the room with you tube app as there'was just local channels to watch. Wifi was good. Checked in was pretty fast and no hassle. The pool area were nice with sitting area to enjoy the windy breeze.  Overall it was ok. Location wise is centralized good.",6,Mar-21,
Hotel Boss,"Big hotel with many small rooms. Kind of like sewage smell in the premises and in our room. Poor sound proof as Iâm a light sleeper, could hear somebody talking in the middle of 3am. We stayed the inward facing family room with balcony, only view is another room just opposite. Noise with echo can project from this inward area, which I could also hear in the middle of night with a group of people talking and laughing. Is more light a chalet rather a hotel. From picture room floor looks light laminated wood flooring but is actually tiles with woody design. Our family have another premier balcony room which is better at least is city view with big balcony. Felt complex if you drive to the carpark, you will see lots of motor cycle at level 2, some even ride recklessly. However theâ¦",6,Mar-21,
Hotel Boss,"I was at a 5 and 6 star hotels before heading to Hotel Boss with my family. Out of the 3 hotels, Mr Kar Heng left me the deepest impression in terms of service excellence. Professional and is sincere when attending to guests. There were others In suits which I assume hold a higher appointment than him but they should go to Kar Heng to learn a thing about service.  Room size is small and you get what you paid for. But cleanliness shouldn't be taken lightly. Hairs on the bed and toilet sink found upon check in.  Instead of only being the biggest mid tier hotel, try being the Best mid tier hotel instead.",8,Mar-21,
Hotel Boss,"The pros are location and view from balcony is wonderful. Weâre on a high floor. Strong breeze and nice city skyline. Plenty of options around for food, both hawker and restaurants. The auntie in charge of room sanitation is friendly, helpful and quick when we asked for fresh pillow cases.   The cons are hairdryer doesnât work, dated decor and furnishings, poor soundproofing, secondhand smoke from neighbours on the balcony. Itâs a non smoking hotel but people flout the rules, which isnât the hotelâs fault but dampens the experience. I can hear my neighbours quarrelling at night and loud traffic below. The mattress is not the most comfortable. Ordinary facilities. The central AC is in need of a deep cleanse.",6,Mar-21,

Hotel Boss,"Check-in was quite fast and simple. Rooms were on a nice high floor and had quite a good view. The rooms were quite clean, the mattress was very comfortable but the pillows were much too soft. Bottled water is already provided in the room, only thing missing would probably be a pair of disposable bed slippers. The room could afford to be abit more noise-proof. Could hear people walking and talking in the corridors easily. Breakfast needs to seriously be improved though. The serers were very welcoming and polite with warm smiles, however the western and asian breakfasts should be served hot. It was barely lukewarm. Especially when your serving food like scrambled eggs and bacon, ham and sausage and pancakes, all these should be hot. Its a good thing customers could still toastâ¦",6,Apr-21,

Amenities was basic with toothbrushes, shower gel and conditioning shampoo.Â  I didn't like the dispenser with sheets of paper I stead of a toilet roll.Â  Thankfully I was prepared and brought my own toilet roll. There is a writing table, a chair and a beside table.Â  Bottled water was provided and the mini fridge was cold enough to store your own stuff.

On their site it was showing a different rooms than what we got.  Breakfasts buffet was okay. Overly crowded due to the high demand.  Staffs were friendly and helpful specially the bell boys.  Hotelâs location is outstanding. 5 mins walk from lavender MRT and right opposite BLK 461 bus station which connects to almost every other place in Singapore downtown.

Hotel Boss,"Hotel Boss sounded like a good deal at first. 4stars are over rated. Rooms are tiny, sound proofing, what is that? Showers and toilet flushing disturb your sleep in the middle of the night. The liftbell, the banging of the lift counter weights will not help your sleep either. Finally every word spoken on the corridor will make it to your room. Can only recommend it when you go out for some drinks and return completely hammered.",4,Sep-22,

The view out of the balcony is pretty mediocre but in my opinion (FYI: the balcony have no privacy at all so PLEASE do not be in your birthday suit). Jokes aside, when i entered into the room the first time i was surprised that it was soooo small when i say small i meant really small but it isnt much of a problem. The cleanliness of the room iâd say is 4.5/5. The bed is decent size and comes with 2 pillow total one for me and one for my GF. On the second day we decided to ask for 2 more pillow and when we ask the counter for pillow, i was greeted with a kind gentleman that promptly asked me for my room numberâ¦",8,Jan-21,

Thankfully, one of the staff on level 1 was there to assist. So had to go up and down nonetheless it was solved less than 20 mins.   Check out took less than 10 mins. Good overall stay. Bus stop directly infront of hotel. There is a Cheers outside. Walking/bus distance to either Lavendar station or Bugis.",8,Dec-20,

Location wise I would say one of the best, centrally located close to Bugis and Lavender MRT stations and close proximity to Orchard road, city hall and Bugis, buses available a step away. The famous Arab street is just a short walk away. The lobby of the room was really nice but the rooms were really small. Check-in was a breeze but the front office could be a little more courteous. Many restaurants and food options in the vicinity and we decided not to opt for in-house breakfast and thought to explore the many eateries in the surrounding.

I was pleased with the accommodation and food, however, i was very upset and disappointed by the swimming pool queueing system.

Covid-19 is the excuse the hotel uses to justify one of many lies: queueing at the pool (no booking possible), our family room looks like a dark closet, the noise on the balcony gives the feeling to be on a highway...

It was my birthday and my family was looking forward to this staycation. Definitely not happy with the service given. Need to improvise. I know itâs on full occupancy and there were too many guests but atleast some smiles are good enough.   Rooms was in a decent size, all clean and in good condition. Did get a low floor but itâs okay. Tv was good with youtube. View was beautiful.  Jubilious restaurant served halal food and itâs great! Pool was huge and looks clean.

Since it is a ""different"" quote, I thought it would be better not to book on the website and I tried several forms of communication, all without answer, until now.   Today we made a call and were attended by a rude person, difficult to understand, who insisted that we would be doing SHN when it is not the case and in the end he ordered us to book on the website.

The staff are nice.   We got 4 rooms cause we are 16 pax, it's just a shame that the family room is not on the same floor as the 3 rooms because they said that there is only one family room per floor.  What I don't like is that they only clean the rooms once a week (but i'm not reaaly that sure if it is once a week only) because we stayed there for 3 nights and 3 days we thought that everyday they will clean the rooms. We got 4 rooms cause we are 16 pax. Although when i ask the front desk about it they said their schedule and if we want to ask for anything, they could give us like(bottled water, towels,etc.) and the night before we checked out someone talked to me at the lobby and his a foreigner also and staying at the hotel, he asked me if i wanted to give him a massage in his room. I got scared and goes back to our room fast. I didn't report to the receptionist cause i got scared.

Hotel Boss,Well it was nice. I love its location. I am a Bugis Junction fan and its surrounding area. Just feels home too. I love the pool it was nice. The beds are good. Toilet is exceptional. The shower is working well. No problem with the sink. Its not 32m square so thats why the room I rent was a little squeezy. But I am roaming around most of the time outdoor.  The Plasma TV was great too. Overall had a nice stay.  Thank you.,10,Feb-21,
Hotel Boss,"I just had a resting Time at Hotel Boss. Classified as a bit above Average as it has a Gym and a swimming pool which is a node above the Budget Hotel.  The staffs here are friendly and met some Sporeans who are also on Staycation there, seems that they are also enjoying themselves. The location is good as it is not too far from the city.   It is also suitable for couples for a Staycation as mine was Queen size bed. They have parking spaces  for those who drive which is convenient.  Overall, I find it relaxing at a stay at this Hotel !",6,Jan-21,

Hotel Boss,"We booked this place on a rather last minute basis as our air bnb cancelled on us at the 11th hour!! Thankfully, Agoda was running some specials and had a voucher applied to our booking.   We stayed here during Christmas period (7 days). I want sure what to expect add we really didn't have much time to research. But I was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel being a fantastic choice. It's SO convenient - access to MRT, proximity to food and with many choices available. I would come back here in a heartbeat.   The moment we arrived, staff greeted us and took care of it bags while we checked in. The lobby area is extremely spacious with plenty of comfortable sofas to sit on whilst waiting to be served or for a taxi ride.   The reception staff are super efficient and helpful.â¦",8,Dec-19,

Hotel Boss,The room we previously had was very small and crampy. The officer who attended to us suggested the family room and he upgraded us with a good price. The family room though it was a little larger than the previous one bt it fits all of us nicely..,8,Apr-20,
Hotel Boss,"Friendly staff and nice hotel Clean, comfortable and care. Near to go anywhere.  Near to mosque, restaurants, Mustafa, bus stations MRT.  Nice view. A staff name Leslie and friends such a good and friendly to us.Tqvm.",10,May-19,
Hotel Boss,I have stayed in this hotel throughout the lockdown in Singapore and was very satisfied with my stay. Well managed covid-19 precautions and I especially liked the staff on the 18th floor. Kenny and Nanthanat were a great help and very nice people.  I will be coming back.,10,May-20,
Hotel Boss,"The service was very bad and unprofessional. We requested for water to be sent to our room and we waited for almost 45mins and had to call twice. They were not apologetic at all. Later the night we requested for fork and spoons as we wanted to eat in our room but to my horror, they said they were out of spoons?? What kind of 4 star hotel doesn't have enough spoons.. They eventually provided us with two wooden chopsticks and two plastic forks.. what a disappointment. And to add on, when we checked in, the room floor was dusty and didn't seem to be cleaned properly, did not feel comfortable staying here at hotel boss.",4,Apr-20,
Hotel Boss,"It's a budget friendly hotel located very nearby to little india food market. The services are amazing. The breakfast overall was amazing but as a pure vegetarian I just had a option of bread,tea and coffee. So a drawback for food options book without breakfast and u can go to nearby Indian chain of restaurants. Overall a pleasant stay . There is bus stands and metro station nearby which is a plus point. Below pics are the view from my room. ",10,Jan-20,
Hotel Boss,This is a very clean and practical hotel in an ideal location. I got a taxi from the taxi and was shocked by a) how cheap it was but b) how well organised everything was when i arrived at hotel boss. Tan Lin Chong showed me to my room and was very kind and helpful! Thanks! ,8,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"My daughter and I recently spent 6 days and 5 nights in Singapore.  Hotel Boss gave us a clean, compact twin bed room with all the facilities one expects of a good business hotel, and at a very reasonable cost.  Its location is perfect for quick access to the metro or bus services and it is within walking distance of many places on the first-time visitor's list like Kampung Gelam and Little India.  Besides that, it is quite close to the airport so the cab transit is cheap.  If you choose (and I recommend this) not to eat breakfast at the hotel, there are dozens of options to fit every appetite and budget just outside and a few steps away.  The reception and housekeeping staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.  If I had the opportunity to visit this wonderful island again, Iâ¦",10,Mar-20,

Hotel Boss,"I found myself unexpectedly stuck in transit, and my work put me in this hotel.  The room was clean and comfortable, but fairly basic; I found that the water temperature in the shower at night was less hot than it was in the morning, for some reason.  What made the stay pleasant was that all the staff were consistently very friendly, polite and accommodating.  Also, the hotel is in a pretty good location and within walking distance of Arab Street and some good local eateries.  Would stay there again.",8,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"Hassle-free with Fiona Liu. Efficient and professional. Thank you so much! Thank you for also making my 18th birthday memorable with the good services and booking issues. I accidentally made a wrong date book but with her help, everything went by smoothly",10,Mar-20,

Hotel Boss,"Hotel Boss is near the Lavender MRT. It is a fairly big place - with a large number of rooms. Like every other place in Singapore, the service is professional. The rooms are quite tiny - even by Singapore standards.  The place is conveniently located. Near Little India, Mustafa shopping centre and has plenty of restaurants right under the hotel.",8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"The hotel is very big and very nice with helpful staffs & clean rooms.   Some of the facilities are swimming pool, gymn, & playing ground for kids. The location of the hotel is very strategic, about 3-5 minutes walking distance from Lavender MRT. A bus stop right in front of the hotel. There are restaurants, foodcourt, mini mart and a small park nearby.  Overall, my family & I really enjoy staying in Hotel Boss.",10,Jan-20,
Hotel Boss,"Great location but!! I told reception that my wife had a mobility scooter and asked if my allocated room was big enough to accommodate it. I was assured that it was. It wasnât! I had to open the room door leading to the hotel corridor, reverse the scooter out before I could use the bathroom The breakfast was the worst I have ever had in any hotel in the world The food was cold, the coffee machine didnât work, the staff were surly to the point of rudeness",6,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"My first time in Singapore was great because of hotel boss. I recommend staying here because itâs cleal and the service is outstanding, the check in was easy and itâs very reasonable. Racheal assistanced me by Helping me have a good stay",10,Feb-20,

Hotel Boss,"I came to know about this hotel from one of my friend, every thing about this hotel is good except on the size of the rooms if we are considering as per Indian standard for 3 star and above, however I believe the average size of rooms in Singapore is smaller when compared to India.   Location wise this hotel is located at center place to various places such as little India, lavender MRT and other market.  The hotel staff is very prompt and does make sure that guest are treated nicely.   Hotel rooms are clean and if you include Indian breakfast then it is average, don't expect similar buffet which hotels in India offers to you but it is sufficient. So do go for it.",10,Jan-20,
Hotel Boss,"This high end budget hotel is busy hotel in  great location , also right near Lavender MRT.   Rooms were compact and spotlessly clean and the staff were very attentive and very knowledgeable of Singapore.  The rooms had an amazing view of Singapore!  The only reason I did not give this top marks is the breakfast and breakfast area is not up to the high Singapore standards, I think when I stayed it was exceptionally busy so I will give the hotel the benefit  of the doubt on this occasion. Saying this I would stay here again as it is extremely good value for money all round.",8,Oct-19,
Hotel Boss,The best place to come and stay in this hotel also morning breakfast is best.hotel staff and persons also very helping.hotel entrance is very nice.There is space for your lugage and rachel help for inquiry and we are coming back soon.,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,We had a great time in Hotel Boss. The staff are very accommodating and friendly. We really like the location of the hotel. It is near haji lane and bugis (walking distance). We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family. Thank you Hotel Boss!,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"wonderful in all aspects, stayed here for 3 days. The hotel has a very beautiful lobby, the view from the window is nice. rooms are bit small but nice and cozy. serves fresh food. Miss Rachel here helped me too about my next trip. people here are very co-operative and friendly. definitely gonna come back.",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"First I want to thank Hotel Boss for the early check in without an additional charge. Fatima was friendly and professional and booked me a city view room. I knew the room would be small, so I wasnât disappointed. Easy to get to from Changi on the MRT and only a five minutes walk from Lavender station. Apparently they do have an airport shuttle service for a nominal fee.  If I have another long layover in Singapore, I will go to the Boss.",8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Don't judge a book by its cover. Not a cheap hotel, looks flash and modern  but you will find when you get in reality will surprise you. A super small room (Only sized for 1 person). Our shower door did not close, so leaked water on floor. No hand towels only bath towels and floor mat. The room had a weird smell, one pillow each, one side table, not enough room for more than one suitcase. The room is modern in style but lacks lighting. Breakfast was basic to say the least and more for non European customers. Would we stay again or would we recommend Boss to friends....NO we wouldn't.  Very Disappointing as its location has advantages.",2,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"This hotel is convenient to go around because its location is very near Lavender MRT station. It is easy to look for some foods at below hotel and around the Lavender station. Even hotel room is small (as usual hotel room in Singapore) but the room is nice, clean ans cozy.",8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"We stayed at the triple room on the 9th floor and had a great view of the city skyline. The room was modern, spotless and the beds were comfy, however it was too small but I guess it was mostly the case in Singapore. The location was great, there's a bus stop right outside and the metro was walking distance. It's also close to the famous Arab street and Haji Lane, so there's lots of food options until late. Service was also commendable esp since they let us check in early and allowed us to keep our luggage after check out. Thanks for making our stay in Singapore a comfortable and memorable one!",8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Classic case of you get what you pay for. We stayed here for three nights while travelling through Asia and this was by far the most expensive hotel, purely because of the location however! Worth spending a bit more money and staying elsewhere.   Pros Location not too bad - 10-15 min walk to nearest metro station.  Has a gym although very limited.  Large swimming pool  Cons No offer to help carrying our heavy bags up to the room. Seemed to be self service form the start!  First room was near the lifts and extremely noisy - despite specifically requesting a quiet room. No excuse for this, plenty of empty rooms in a hotel if this size especially given current affairs. Basic customer service.  Safety deposit box did not work in the first room  Duvet cover torn  Moved to a secondâ¦",4,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Stayed at family room for one night to celebrate birthday. Hotel didnât provide any cake despite was informed. Room was clean, with balcony. Room size was quite small but acceptable for short term stay. Basic amenities were provided. However, there was no hot water at night and only hot water in morning. They need to check their heater system. Staff at check in counter and level 1 restaurant were very friendly. ",8,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"When I checked in on the 11th, the particular GSO(Bella) who served me wasn't really friendly and definitely gave me the unwelcoming vibes.   However, my friends and I was greeted by another GSO(Nurul) on the second night of our stay with pleasant hospitality vibes and definitely makes our experience a whole lot better.   Overall the hotel is a very nice establishment for fun time with friends and loved ones.  Will definitely come back there soon.",8,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"I've stayed in Hotel boss on 13th March for 1 night. I was given a room that was definitely not my preference but thanks to Nurul, 1 of the staff working on that day.

Hotel Boss,Rooms minuscule. Spotless and comfortable. Quiet. Restaurant was appalling. Reheated food undercooked and staff off hand. No one else used it. Cafe in entrance speedy and good.  Would only recommend for an overnight stay.,4,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our short stay. We cannot fault Hotel Boss at all. In terms of Customer service, Friendliness, Cleanliness we definitely would rate your establishment 10 stars. The Food court which is below the hotel was such a nice surprise and the varied food choices were absolutely delicious. The only con was that the room was small but hey we did not come to Singapore to be in a room all day. The location is perfect close to everything. We would definitely be back for a longer stay, 3 days were far too short. Thank you for your Hospitality, much appreciated.",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Last week , I stayed at Hotel Boss in Singapore for 6 days.  I had a nice city view room on 16th floor which was extremely comfortable, clean, modern, with all facilities, and at a very reasonable rate. It caters well for  families, couples and singles It is very convenient for bus services and Lavender MRT station. There is a large pool on the 4th floor, laundry facilities and although it is a large hotel, the staff from maids to reception to management are extremely pleasant and helpful. I must also single out Mr William Lew, the Senior Guest Services Manager , who was most helpful in retrieving my lost phone from a taxi.   Stay here, itâs ideal! ",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,Its very good experience with hotel boss .  Very good room service . All staff especially the name girl bella is very kind and helpful to us .  The entire property of this hotel is well maintained .  We had good conversation with  Guest service supervisor Rachel .,10,Feb-20,

Hotel Boss,The hotel is recently built and has a good pool. The rooms are small but adequate for short term needs - two or three nights. Staff are friendly and attentive. Access to metro is less than five minutes or taxis are always waiting and are a reasonable cost. Breakfast buffet is ok and worth the 12 dollars but the coffee shop is expensive. There is a very good shop outside and a money changer with good rates. We enjoyed our stay and would happily return.,8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"I had a great stay at Hotel Boss.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable and had blackout shades, which was a nice plus!  The pool area was very nice, and the hotel was conveniently located.  Definitely recommend!",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,Staying at Hotel Boss was so convenient and relaxing. The staff are accommodating and friendly. Our flight arrived Saturday and we were able to check in easily and have good rest before exploring the rest of Singapore. It was also easy to go around because it's walking distance from a lot of establishments and tourist spots.   A big thanks to Ms.Fiona Liu for being helpful and always making sure we had a great time during our stay!,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Very accomodating and kind staffs, especially miss fiona liu, the assistant guest service manager. Room is very clean and fresh.

Hotel Boss,Absolutely recommended for its value for money. Good sized swimming pool with ample space to relax and unwind.  Breakfast is reasonably priced and good tasting.   Conveniently located 2 minutes walk away from nearest train station which is very near to city / CBD.   Beds are very comfortable and best of all TV channels played various interesting Hollywood titles.   4 out of 5 star review due to the fact that noise cancellation can be further improved. Overall a very pleasurable stay.,8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,Highly recommended hotel in SG! The staff at lobby counter named Fiona Liu is very helpful and friendly  with our booking. Facilities and environment is way more better than other hotels in sg.  ðððð»ðð»,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,Great Hospitality and maintained proper hygiene and was very quick in servicing..... just room problem with superior room too small so if you have to stay take premium balcony room with bigger size... Rachel from the staff was helpful with us in our stay,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"The room was the smallest I have had anywhere. There was barely enough room to walk around the bed, no drawers and not enough room to even unpack a case. The only hanging space was a few coat hangers on a rail above the television.   It had a nice outside area with a swimming pool but very few beds and even fewer chairs. The only sitting area is in the lobby which got very congested with people looking after their luggage.  This hotel was so basic I moved to another hotel.",4,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,Pleasantly greeted and served by Faizal during check-in. Efficient and prompt. Very good impression for a first time visit. Location is good and the room is decent. Also a great place for people who drives as there is free parking provided :),10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,The hotel is close to the airport and the mrt thatâs one of the reasons why we chose Hotel Boss. Once we arrived we were greeted by Fiona the assistant service manager. Fiona was very helpful and helped us with some of Singapore attractions. We are a family of 9 with four children so that was very helpful.,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Nice hotel in a central location, close to the train station and eateries. Hotel has free parking and near number of places of attraction. The concierge Faizal was particularly warm and efficient with his service, helping me to check in quickly!",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Accomodation is good, the food is good and tasty, the personels are hospitable and approachable specially ms. Fiona Liu (the hotel lobby manager) they help us around, our baggages are very much secured.",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Itâs near lots of halal good food, and massage areas! Staff also allowed us a late checkout for free. We used the gym once. It was nice but a bit small, and the ventilation wasnât good there so it got a little stuffy, but maybe it was because we visited the gym after the operating hours (it was still open for guestsâ use though, we didnât hack it or anything)  The room was really nice and clean, super comfortable stay. Will definitely come here again :)",10,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"This hotel was a great stop off for a couple of days sightseeing. Itâs a large hotel thatâs known by all taxi drivers and is in close proximity to all transport links and less than 20mins to the airport. Lots of eateries in the locality. Itâs a mid range standard with an affordable price range- significantly lower than many large hotels in Singapore. The amenities in the room are a little basic and the rooms are exceptionally small, however, given the cost of real estate and the price of other accommodation- this was a minor inconvenience. This is a great choice for reliable accommodation in an accessible location.  ",6,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,I just spent three days in this hotel. It has everything you need. The room is clean and is equipped with darkened shades.it is close to the Lavender MRT. I was able to reach the Central area in 15 minutes. I look forward to my next stay at the end of the month.,10,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"Very quick check in and check out. The room is reasonably clean. Simple, practice, easy to reach from Changi airport. Also very easy to find food around the hotel. The staff is helpful.  The price is a bit more compare to what we expect to received. But in Singapore, everything is not cheap. Recommended to stay when you have short business trip to Singapore.",10,Dec-19,
Hotel Boss,"Must admit it serves the best for the price paid in city center. Gym and pool is decent, lobby is spacious for reception of 200-300 check-in at a go.  The only shortfall will be the room configuration will be more market concentric for tourists instead of business traveler.",8,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"Great services, friendly staff, Delirious food, Fully furnished hotel, pet allowed in this hotel, Fully ac hotel, great out seeing and seprated smoking area fress wif i services in hoels, swimming pool is good",10,Nov-19,
Hotel Boss,"I stayed in Hotel Boss for stay cation for quite a couple of times already. Have always loved its location together with its decent value. Definitely well maintained. Only a few minutes walk from Bugis MRT and to Haji Lane/Arab Street/Kampong Glam (foodies will love it here as there are plenty of cafe's all over. There is street art too!) If you have a feel for Indian food, you can head down to Little India, Mustafa Center (Hypermarket) or City Square (Shopping Mall) which takes approximately 15 minutes walk from the hotel. My friend and I parked our vehicle in the hotel's car park the whole time! Thanks to the friendly staffs who provided me a complimentary car park ticket and always making my check-in and check-out process a smooth one!",10,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"Wonderful experience for a decent value. Great service as well from the Concierge expert, Mr Faizal and his teammates, Bella and Solha, as they handled a group of troubled customers professionally. It is very convenient to have food stalls near the proximity within walking distance. So for those foodies out there, this place is highly recommended.",10,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"Good Budget Hotel,  well maintained, bit compact rooms and walk-able (15min) to Little India. Deserve full 5 star rating. Will consider to stay here again if i travel to Singapore. Thanks to the friendly staff.",10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,This for all travelers who like to visit Singapore please book your hotel( hotel boss) because the all staff are really caring and friendly to all customers. And I lost my phone at the taxi and I informed to Mr. Faizal and he and the staff got the vehicle number and star calling to cab services and the soon the taxi driver send me the phone within 20 minutes to the hotel. Iâm full surprised I never thought I can get very fast and quick. Really appreciate you all services and thanks thousands times for really care for us.,10,Mar-20,
Hotel Boss,"Stayed here for 3 nights in november. We had a balcony room and were glad we paid a little extra as we saw the standard rooms and they were tiny! Ours wasnt that much bigger but not so chlastaphobic as we had the large balcony to use too. Breakfast was mainly indian food! Not quite what I fancy for breakfast so we made do with scrambled egg, sausage and toast and jam. Good location, close to a corner shop for goodies for the room and close to metro too to get anywhere within the city. We did the hop on hop off bus tour where we explored most of the sights of the city so definately a good idea if you want to see everything. Probably cheaper booking online too although hotel price was only about Â£7 difference. Overall good hotel at a reasonable rate",8,Nov-19,
Hotel Boss,We would like to highly recommend HOTEL BOSS for giving us 5 star serice. The service was excellent and beyond! Aside from the service given by FIONA LIU and the rest of the reception. The location was just superb and its closed by the train station. The service just made our trip memorable. Thank you again to the rest of the crew for making it possible!! Fiona liu thank you!,10,Feb-20,

Hotel Boss,OMGosh. What a wonderful and friendly place to stay at. Could not ask for better service from the concierge Tan Lin Chong. Let us know things that where close by in walking and driving distance. Recommend a few other places to visit ,10,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Conveniently located only 5 minutes on foot from a metro station on the airport line via a covered walkway, everything worked, and the staff were very friendly.   That's about it.  Zero atmosphere and design flair, small rooms, poor buffet breakfast, and the ""everything worked"" hides the fact that the room was equipped to the absolute minimum even for a 3-star hotel.   A 4-star rating is at the limit of generosity.  But would I stay there again?  Yes, for a short business visit.",8,Feb-20,
Hotel Boss,"Check in could've been smoother probably if I didn't choose the trainee :) Welcome drinks would have been a nice touch as it was hot and humid outside. Good nCoV precautions with the temperature check. Didn't see any hand sanitizers though. The one that assisted us with the luggage was up to the task but a bit lost in translation? They granted our request for a room in the upper floors. we should have included a view of the city. Their rooms were pitch black and the duvet and temperature control, helped get some much needed sleep. We were allowed late check out, no extra charges. The kids enjoyed the pool a bit. Bathrooms was basic, maybe consider having a bidet? Location was near Lavender MRT that was convenient. Also 11 minutes walk to Mustafa Center and City Square Mall whereâ¦",8,Feb-20,

Hotel Boss,"My husband and I were staying in Premier Queen (Balcony) type of room. As a result, we had a chance to relax on our private sunbeds and enjoy spectacular view from the balcony in one of the top floors. In general the rooms and common areas were clean and nice. The only thing that disappointed was breakfast. We had chosen a Halal buffet, but when we came to have it (around 9.00-10.00 a.m.) tables were almost empty and we had to ask for food...",8,Nov-19,
Hotel Boss,Reception check-in fast & efficient  Concierge helpful and obliging  Lobby/foyer resembled a circus.. exceptionally busy most hours of the day. Hotel obviously caters to major groups en-mass Room exceptionally small Room not serviced till late afternoon x 4 days Not even a glass in the room to enjoy a drink and a major drama (duty Mgr with attitude) to obtain such. One would expect a glass in a hotel of standards to be a necessary accessory?? No power-point facility in bathroom. Overall a disappointing experience.,4,Dec-19,
Hotel Boss,"My visit to Singapore and especially staying again at the Hotel Boss was excellent. Mr. Justin Lee and Keith took very good care of me. Justin helped me to scan some documents, provide Complimentary Car Parking for my associates etc.. The stay at the Hotel was perfect as usual. I recommend the Hotel Boss to everyone. This was my third or fourth stay. Very convenient to restaurants, shopping, business centers, MRT, Bus Lines. Good food court around the corner. I got a late check out today as I was a bit tired.

Central to most things needed with food, shopping and transport only a short walk away. Great Value with very Clean rooms; friendly staff and a wonderful pool area.

Hotel Boss,"The hotel boss room rates are fair considering everything in Singapore is so expensive. The rooms are really small. Fit for one person only. The standard rooms donât even have a closet/space to put your luggage. If traveling as a family, it would be better to get a bigger room/ several rooms. The facilities are very nice. Many restaurants and cafes available in the building. The hotel is near Lavender MRT AND Bus stop so itâs very convenient to move around. The breakfast choices are limited. The staff are friendly and the WiFi is pretty strong.",8,Dec-19,

Thereâs no ventilation in bathroom and thereâs moss growing on bathroom tiles and shower head. Also 3inch dirt and broken plates under bed! Most staff are friendly except some at breakfast table. Found 1 lady specifically to be quite rude. Breakfast is ok, could be better variety, and exact same menu every single day. Location very convenient and lots to do around. Pool area very nice and relaxing. In general, ok for a day or 2, not for longer stays or if you are planning to spend more time in hotel.",6,Dec-19,
Hotel Boss,"I spent 9 nights with my family in Boss Hotel. The staff at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and hygienic and there was absolutely no smell of cigarette as smoking was prohibited in this hotel (different from some of the comments we read before about this hotel) It was comfy and quiet (again unlike what was said in other comments) and my 3 years old baby had a great time here. I like 4/F in particular because of its modern and stylish swimming pool and gym room! Lastly, I have to express my thanks to Kannika, my room attendant, who kept our room very clean and tidy!

The Hotel is clean and busy, No toilets in Reception area but there are outside. The rooms however are VERY small and no wardrobes (there is hanging space) great for a couple of nights stay due to position.

As this was our first time staying at this hotel, I was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel is located near to Lavender MRT, proximity to food and shops.   The moment we arrived, staff greeted us and took care of our bags while we checked in. The lobby area is extremely spacious with plenty of comfortable sofas to sit on.The reception staff are very efficient and helpful.    There were a few minor things. When we booked our rooms, we didn't realized our room on the 18th Floor Block B was facing another grey building. The corridors carry sound very easily and guests are often not very considerate.  One night we had to call the reception to complain about the guests next to our roomâ¦",8,Dec-19,

Hotel Boss,Pictures were extremely deceiving  My boyfriend and I are from the States on vacation and it seems nice a big on the outside but they really squeezed as many rooms into that building as possible. Almost impossible to walk around the bed because there was no place to store our luggage No closet Safe did not work The balcony room that we had the balcony was 1/2 the size of the room itself.  Not to mention the amount of empty space around the pool Went to the pool to lay out and maybe take a dip but there was only 11lounge chairs for this pool. Had ample space to add more and it was just empty Also no clean towels around the pool area all dirty  DO NOT RECOMMEND. Unless ur used to staying in a shoebox. ,2,Jan-20,

Hotel Boss,"Hotel is huge with large number of roomsand that is their advantage. They always have rooms available at decent price and have tie ups with travel portals like MakeMyTrip etc. No much thrills or frills in hotel.

If you are here on romantic/honemoon vacations, you may be disappointed as I said the rooms are average with no thrills and frills.",8,Jan-20,
Hotel Boss,"Nice hotel  and great position. It is near MRT station and buses,also places to eat. Pool looks great, rooms are small but usual for Singapore.  Don't bother with room with balcony as you are facing others walls or windows.  Found this very hard as no natural sunlight.",8,Jan-20,
Hotel Boss,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Boss, it's clean hotel, wifi is fast and the cost is affordable.  We could see people check in and check out of the hotel since the hotel is huge, there's 100 rooms in each floor and we stayed on the 19th floor.

Hotel Boss,"The hotel is situated near the Little India part of Singapore. We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. We took notice of the reviews before we went and upgraded to a premier room so that we had a reasonable space to stay in. I can confirm that the cheaper rooms are very small. We had very little interaction with the staff, but those we sought assistance from, were very helpful. The 18th floor room provided spectacular views of Singapore.   We found the room quite nice, the furniture was of a good standard, and the bathroom was acceptable. Everything was clean. Again, having read the reviews we stayed well clear of the restaurant and found many cheap local places quite close by with good quality food at very reasonable prices. For example, we paid 4.00 Singapore dollars for duck inâ¦",8,Dec-19,

The lobby is always full of many people but check-in and check-out is fast and there are 2 sets of elevators so that you can quickly get to your floor/room.      My room was too small and after stowing my luggage there was literally no space to move. On the other hand the bed was very comfy and the room was very clean.    The staff are very polite and helpful. There was an issue with the flush of the toilet in my room but the housekeeping responded promptly and I was given another room on a higher floor which was bigger and had a balcony with a nice view of Singapore.

Hotel Boss,"Excellent location and excellent service. 2 minutes walk to Lavender MRT, from where almost all tourist spots are easily accessible and 10 minutes walk to Little India. The hotel has a food court which has all sorts of cuisines at a very reasonable rate. Though rooms are small, it won't make much of a difference for tourists as the time they spend in room is going to be less. The beds were still spacious enough. We stayed in a triple room, which had a double bed and a single bed.Service by the staff was excellent. Check in and check out took just minutes. And the view from the room was simply breathtaking.

Hotel G Singapore,"Hotel G was very accommodating to my needs. I had my wedding on one of the afternoons and Hotel G allowed us to do a small gatecrash pick-up from the hotel room. Upon hearing that I will be having wedding, Hema gave me a complimentary free room upgrade to King room and provided free welcome mocktail vouchers for us, as well as a complimentary late check-out on the next day. The bigger sized room definitely gave us more space to put our bulky items as well as getting makeup done. The room was very clean, space was pretty okay, all basic necessities were there. What I like most about the room is the platform which the bed was on. I was able to put many bags and things on the platform instead of having to put them on the floor. Toilet was quite spacious for this price of the room.â¦",10,Sep-21,

After some fees that were required due to booking through a third party, the Hotel G manager, Daryl took great care of us as he understood what we were going through and made the stay worthwhile.  I would really like to thank him for his wonder service as my girlfriend was upset with me for making such a dumb mistake but his service calmed her down, What more could i ask for?

Besides that the location is very close to bugis+ and bugis Street and there are plenty of food around the area as well. Overall a great experience. Will be back for more",10,Oct-21,
Hotel G Singapore,The hotel room is small but pretty well decorated with indie design. But the whole hotel experience was elevated by Daryl who was a knowledgeable and amiable staff.

Hotel G Singapore,"For a 4* hotel, the facilities are a little underwhelming. The gym is small yet functional, no pool, the room is really cosy (read: small). Bathroom in good room have only little standing room for 1 person, I will easier hit the wall with a little bit bod stretch. Thankfully the water pressure is decently strong.  Noise isolation is really sub-par. I cannot sleep well due to adjacent room having loud conversations and blasting music late into the night. Staff are prompt to address feedback of the noise at 2am when called.  There are some good green initiatives in the hotel. They provide drinking water in paper cartons and rooms are cleaned every 3 days of stay.  My experience at Hotel G Singapore was elevated by the excellent service provided by Daryl.

Yvonne's hospitality really made us feel so welcomed, we immediately knew we were in good hands!   Rooms were fine at its price, not big but sufficient. Cozy and vintage layout was surprisingly inviting especially after a stroll around the vicinity in search of good food. Room was clean and water pressure in the shower was stronger than in my own house LOL.

The tone of my stay was off to a notable start during my brief, yet endearing encounter with front office staff Nana and Assistant Front Office Manager Yvonne, whom welcomed me with stupendously positive, blithe energy.   Upon setting foot into the room, a whiff of cold air swept past my âheatedâ body (itâs almost 31degrees that day so itâs very much appreciated) and my ears were simultaneously greeted with the hotelâs curated playlist playing in the midst.

I feel the pillow is quite flatten but it could be better. The plus point is if the toilet has bidet. Other than that, all is good.   Place is good for solo staycay to have a proper me-time.

She has arranged a more spacious and quieter room for our stay, and even extended a complimentary late check-out for us. The check-in was swift and hassle-free. Bella was also considerate enough to check with us on the parking duration before offering cheaper exit option by getting their carpark ticket at flat $15 only.

Hotel G Singapore,"Stayed in this hotel last weekend, purchased the 3D2N deal using the SRV voucher with plenty of perks to enjoy. Check-in was a breeze, friendly and helpful associates explaining every detail. Room was super cozy, A/C, shower water pressure and hot water was perfect. Water tends to splash out despite having a shower curtain but not a deal breaker. Loved the complimentary champagne too. Pillows were a bit too thin though.  Burgers from 25 Degrees (package) were so good, they weren't scrimping with the patty sizes. Preferred the Number One over the Number Two. Dined at Ginett and used the F&B dining voucher. Olio Scampi was a tad bland, but the prawns were juicy. Wine vouchers (from spotting difference in lift doors) were used, and was great too.   Shame there wasn't a fridge as weâ¦",10,May-21,

Hotel G Singapore,"Went for a one night staycation. Staff at check in counter was very friendly.   Our room was quite warm at first, so we suspect our aircon not functioning well. Called the front desk and they immediately sent someone to look up on the issue. Efficient. The room cooled down quickly afterwards.   Breakfast was delivered to our room, as we could not dine at the cafe downstairs due to new government restrictions. Nevertheless, the food was good.  Only concern was the switch to one of our lights (the one at the door entrance) were spoilt, so the light could not turn on.  Overall, excellent staycation experience!",10,May-21,
Hotel G Singapore,"Hotel is conveniently located. Restaurant and burger joint downstairs serves really good food. Room was cozy and clean. Staff were really friendly, patient, understanding and ever ready to be of service and help make our stay was as enjoyable as possible, always checking and asking if we needed anything else when we saw them or requested for something. Could tell that the staff sincerely wanted our stay to be memorable and comfortable, especially Ms Ziwei who checked us in. She went the extra mile by placing a pre-brought cake in our room to surprise my son for his birthday when we went out to run errands. Couldn't have surprised him without her help! Only thing was we couldn't use the gym because of covid restrictions, so we can't rate that. But we are already planning nextâ¦",10,May-21,

The main reason why I chose Hotel G was the convenient and central location. After a day of working on my laptop, I look forward to relax and explore the places around me.

It is her professionalism and well mannered natured that is appreciated and because of such example provided by her, it truly is a go to hotel.   We arrived about two days earlier to make payment and she attended to us and was really quick transaction, her engagement was sincere with eye contact and just very warm personality towards us.   So as we made our way to check out, we bumped into her in the lift on the way and she politely said that she will drop the key cards for us. Which was really lovely.

They work and move very fast whenever you request things to be sent to your room. I love the pillow as it's not very high and good for people with bad neck.   It's not a grand room, but more on the vintage look. Completed with a very beautiful and big dream catcher :)",10,Jul-21,

Hotel G Singapore,"I don't really want to write this review but I am disappointed the room assignment. My first stayed room was assigned 1212, room cleanliness was tip top clean. Second room assigned on my second stay room was 1116, built in socket was loose and even engineering fixed it while I away from work. I came back and tried to charge doesn't work still loose. I extend my stay and requested high floor but receptionist mentioned not available since I waited for room for a few hours, why can't I get a high floor room. Third room 805, silicone mouldy, shower sliding door rubber mouldy and even ceiling built up with black fungus. Shower curtain was extremely smelly! Totally disgusting and disappointing!  What ever I requested none of it is fullfilled. Please look into the above matter.",2,Jul-21,
Hotel G Singapore,"despite the heightened phase, we still managed to have a pleasant staycay at Hotel G thanks to the manager on duty, Darryl Goh.

Hotel G Singapore,"Checking in was smooth, room door was already open so i assume the room just did the housekeeping and no one was inside. Room wise pretty small for a queen bed sharing. Amenities were basic, one of the small hand towel and a cup used for coffee drinking had a stain and cup inside was dirty. Bottom line, i had a good night sleep!",6,Jul-21,
Hotel G Singapore,"Check in took an hour, due to the fact that the hotel has a very good promotion and it was during the period where very little hotels are open for staycation.  Booked Good Room that comes with $50 dining credit at Ginett and breakfast.  Room is ok, matches with what I paid for. The room does feel a little small, but it should be good enough for 2 normal sized adults.  In room channels are decent.  Breakfast area is crowded, hotel gave the option to take away back to the room.  Overall, good for a 1 night stay.",8,Oct-20,

Hotel G Singapore,"The staff at Hotel G were really friendly and went above and beyond to put together something for our special day. Kudos to Daryl and Nana for helping us with the room booking and arrangement. My husband and I were really thankful and enjoyed our stay. The room was small and cosy and the location of the hotel was good. The only thing would be the carpark, the direction seems a bit off and a pity that it doesnât have a pool and a fridge in the room. But nonetheless, it was an enjoyable and memorable stay! Thanks Daryl and Nana! :-)",8,Jun-21,
Hotel G Singapore,"Special kudos goes to Daryl at the front desk for his warm hospitality and helpful suggestions (like late night supper spots in the 'hood).

Apart from the convenient location, hawker centre and shopping malls are nearby and there are a few tourist attractions within walking distance too. Reception services at the front desk are great and hassle free, I was able to check-in fuss free. Booked the Great King Room and in my opinion and it was great. The room had all basic amenities needed for a short stay and it is spacious enough for 2 person.

You have to get an appointment from the receptionist and he (Mr. Luke) insisted it is not open before 6am. No room for negotiation. Basta.   For a 4 Star hotel one would expect a bottle of water in the room, or a shaving set, or maybe both. But neither is available.   Had to go to the reception 3 times until they finally managed to get my card key working.  Yeah, nah, this hotel is a let down.",4,Jun-22,

You are only choose one main course, which is the most terrible and worth to choose to stay at others hotel including buffet breakfast. The hotel management should public explicitly about this option for guest to consider to book at this hotel rather than mention âBreakfast Includedâ - Service is just ok.

Hotel G Singapore,Have stayed many times when visiting Singapore. Very inventive services - I always feel like they think of everything. The staff are also very friendly and helpful even when I asked about some quite complex situations. Only thing that isn't great is you have to walk through a trendy restaurant to get to the entrance so it can be kind of awkward. Otherwise great place.,10,Jun-22,

Our recent stay was a step above, partly due to the amazing service by Daryl the hotel manager.

Was pleasantly surprised when he offered to upgrade us to a bigger and better room and extended our check out timing. Would definitely come here again! Thanks Daryl once again if you see this!",10,Jun-22,
Hotel G Singapore,This is a dysfunctional  establishment which appears to be run to facilitate the the management  not the customer! Different facilities like Ginett and 25Â° are open at different times on different days. You also have to book well in advance for Ginett (during my 6 night stay I was unable to secure a table in the restaurant). The various parts of the âhotelâ are dysfunctional with each other as I was unable to book the restaurant at reception for Tuesday when Ginett was closed on a Monday! I have numerous other examples but since I suspect the management would not be interested I will not waste my time,4,Jun-22,

He also gave us a bottle of red wine, I'm not sure if that's part of the package or it was complimentary by him but we highly appreciated it.  Our room was a King size bed, the room is compact. Just enough to open a large-size luggage but will need to close it back up to have any walking space. The room is fully equipped with all the amenities you can want.

Bad- initially I stayed at Good room for one night, then upgraded to Great Room that is slightly bigger. Still find the rooms very small and not sound proof.   I am very disappointed that the hotel provided expired Body lotion to guests. Realised it when I got back home as I took it home since I used it halfway. I have attached the photos.   The pillows smell so would suggest the hotel air the pillows outdoor or sanitized it.",4,May-22,

Our room was spotless we were on the 6th floor in 0632, the room itself is very small but we knew that before we arrived so wasnt much of a shock, we did joke that the pictures made the room look huge, all basics in the room and really comfy bed with quilted mattress protector which always makes a difference, they have a green policy so wont clean the room the day after you arrive unless you request it which i think is quite a good idea, overall really good experience and would definately stay here again",10,Jun-22,

We were also able to easily walk to Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay. And it is close to three or four metro stops (on different lines) making public transport really easy. The room is very sensibly laid out, with cute touches, a comfy bed, and a waterfall shower. Breakfast is also fantastic; with a wide range of choices (local, international, and âwesternâ - the lentil dal is especially amazing). The staff is also great - especially Matthew at the front desk, who made us feel very welcome at check in.",10,Sep-22,

Toilet is just right for budget travellers, no bidet, but quality of fixtures and toiletries is above average with the rainshower option.   Location is very convenient: - a block away from Bencoleen MRT Stn - a few blocks from Bugis shopping malls and the market  - popular bar downstairs - neighnorhood food stalls nearby  Breakfast option is the bomb!

Hotel G Singapore,"Good location, very close to Bugis, 15 minute walk to Little India, 200 metres to the MRT entrance on Bencoolen St. The check in staff are very helpful.  Interesting decor, I'd call it funky industrial. The rooms (numbers 11 and up on each floor) are unusually long and skinny, maybe 8 metres long and 2 metres wide but after an initial WTF you find it works quite well. Avoid rooms 01, a very small and cramped double, and rooms 02 an even smaller and more cramped single. Everything is very clean, the shower is hot, the bed is good. There are no fridges but an ice bucket is available from the bar downstairs.",8,Aug-22,

There's no wardrobe in this room though so you'll have to hang your clothes by the mirror at the entrance where there's only 4 hangers.

Hotel is at a central location next to a lot of 24/7 open restaurants and supermarkets so we had an amazing experience trying out lots of cuisines (turkish, thai, indian, vietnamese, chinese) and there is like a bar (couple of bars) corner which is open till late (3 am).

Common areas were in general a bit tight, including the car access area to the lobby on Level 2 (bigger cars might have difficulties coming up for pickup/drop-off). Staff service was excellent - friendly, helpful and welcoming. Breakfast provided was basic but of decent quality, and hotel guests are entitled to a discount at a connecting restaurant called 25 Degrees Burgers.

There is a very nice bar with reasonable wine prices at the ground floor and it also has a burger restaurant which also seemed reasonably priced. Bencoolen MRT Station is a short walk and connects with all the main MRT stations including Bayfront. The breakfast was buffet style and was perfect every morning.  Only faults were the size of the room, which made it very difficult to even open a big suitcase and also the lifts are very slow.

Daryl, the senior manager came to know about this and made some arrangements to make the stay that much better I'd say I'd be back here again really soon. Daryl is very hands on, we needed ice at night and it was brought up to our room in an ice bucket by him. He's got such a great personality and it was nice to be welcomed by him. We got the Great King Room and it was such a great space to relax and even get work done! The hotel is also located in such a great spot for food and other amenities. I just loved the whole experience.   P. S. Slipped my mind to take more pictures of the room before we messed it all up but here's it after desperately trying to get the sheets straight.

Hotel G Singapore,"We were attended by Daryl during the check-in process and I am confident to say he was very attentive and friendly. It was our first staycation at Hotel G and he offered a complimentary house pour wine for us to enjoy during our stay. For the room wise, having been through 3D2N, especially at night, I must say the rooms interior decor could be improved. The dark walls and design coupled with the yellow lights were not desirable in our opinion. Room space was constrained and too small to place our items. TV could be a bigger size.",8,Dec-21,

All that, and walkable distance to Orchard, Bugis, Fort Canning and Haji Lane. Couldn't ask for anything more, except perhaps ... we had only one toothbrush kit instead of two (thankfully we brought toothbrushes), and the room floor was not carpeted and felt a little tacky (but quite easily resolved since there were bathroom slippers, and we were very quickly snuggled up in bed).  Special shout-out to Daryl and Hema, who were personable, cheerful and very helpful, even extending our check-out by 30mins so we could go grab that 25degrees burger. Thank you!! :)  â¦",10,Dec-21,

Like that water is in boxed and not in a plastic bottle. Very comfortable bed. If only the LG TV could work with iOS mirroring too, that would be fantastic. Would also like it if there is more space/hook to hang clothes though. Lovely scent with METIS toiletries provided. The room in the corner means it has an accessible toilet. Hawker food lovers must try Parklane Zha Yun Tun Mee House at Sunshine Plaza, opposite only!",10,Jan-22,
Hotel G Singapore,"A pleasant arrival experience with the front desk receptionist named Hema & Hani. They have a great sense of hospitality which parallel to a world class service as they noticed one of the occupant actually celebrating the special occasion (BIR) on the actual arrival day. Kudos to both of them, you both did a brilliant job! On a side note, we would said the express service and the runners were well communicated as from the point we dial â0â to we received the requested item just taken 10 mins which pretty much demonstrated the term âteam workâ! Very well stay! Thanks.",8,Apr-22,

Arrival: Upon arrival at 3 pm, the front desk seemed shorthanded with only 2 staff on duty, line filled the cozy lobby. With limited seatings, the queue snaked towards the lift entrance. Waiting time was about 10mins per guest ahead of you.  Check-In: Frontdesk staff was super friendly, filled with calmness to address guests' every need despite the queue. Kudos to the front desk team!  Room: In their cozy little custom-designed rooms with vintage decor, it's really relaxing with their comfy queen-sized beds.

The hotel is close to a variety of eateries/cafes so itâs good for both locals & tourists to explore this area during their stay here.

It's going to be a long read, so I apologize in advance.  Our (my fiancÃ© and I) first time staying in Hotel G was last year when we decided to use my SRV vouchers to book a staycay during the pandemic. We stumbled upon Hotel G because the partner was looking for a boutique hotel, and personally I wasn't expecting too much because my impression of boutique hotels was that they were usually quite slip-shod or badly-maintained.

We were very happy to come home every night from dinners and drinks with friends to find a constantly stocked minibar that is free! The free shortbread cookies in the lobby were always nice too. The only downside of the room was really that it can be a little cramped if you want to just open up every suitcase you have and splay everything out. Better to be compact here.

Next two disappointed in staff when we asked three different people to change our sheets they simply made them not changing them.  When staying in a hotel for over 5 days myself with possibility of the original sheets of last occupants.  Lastly the pool and pool chairs seemed to be a fungi or dirty which caused itchy.  The good things are the city itself, the staff in lobby are polite spoke English and offered juice.  However, no microwaves in lobby which to reheat food would be nice.  They have a security guard lower level.  Don't know if they offer any rides to or from hotel but they had some tourist brochures in lobby which are nice to see available.

I was not concerned about it as the breakfast was below standard anyway and over priced. Cafes near the hotel served better meals and at a cheaper price. The free minibar was good but I would have preferred having one of the carbonated drinks substituted for another bottle of water.
The location is good as it is close to an MRT and numerous eating places.",6,1-Jul-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"Staff are very helpful, polite and accomodating. The room is clean and nice. The hotel is in a friendly neighborhood. And there are lots of places in the area to eat and shop. ",10,26-Jun-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"Had two nights layover in Singapore and booked the boutique hotel as a last minute stay. Convenient to get around via uber or bus/metro, with easy access to good food (including late night eats) in the vicinity. The hotel staff were friendly, and the rooms were functional (free mini bar was a plus). Toilets could be better designed, as water drainage was not ideal. Highly recommended for a hassle-free stay, with encompassing local experiences within easy reach.",8,20-Jun-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"I only spent one night at NuVe Urbane, arriving pretty late.  The guy at the front desk was really friendly and welcoming.  They also provide fruit juice and some cookies in the lobby, which is a nice touch for a simple hotel.  My room was small but really clean and looked very modern.  The only weird thing was that there was a switch for the water heater that you needed to hit if you wanted a hot shower.  The hot water ran out before I was done, but don't let that scare you -- there is no such thing as cold water in Singapore and the weather ensures that a couple minutes of tepid water is actually comfortable. Perhaps the best thing about NuVe Urbane is the location, right near the heart of Little India, with fantastic eating choices available around the clock and a short walk to 24 hour shopping at Mustafa Center.  Definitely venture out late at night and explore.  ",8,14-Jun-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),All good. Only downside is the late checkin time of 3pm  which is not too convenient for a stopover while on a long flight. ,8,12-Jun-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"This was very good value new accommodation.  Location maybe not the best, but OK if using subway system. Room facilities were first rate. The swimming pool was a godsend with the extreme heat of Singapore.  Only negative would be the breakfast options. better to try elsewhere.",8,17-Aug-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"Great staff. Clean rooms. Very comfortable stay.  Only downside is its a little out of the way from major shopping malls and attractions but not really an issue as Singapore is easy and inexpensive to get around with buses or taxis, plus it's too hot to walk anyway.
Only downside is check in time of 3pm is a little late if you are wanting an overnight stopover before flying on the next day. 12 or 1pm would be much better.",8,8-Jun-18,

Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),Good location only a few blocks from Lavender MRT station. Staff friendly but seemed a little under trained. Biggest problem is the extreme lack of soundproofing in rooms. Was so loud when I checked in I thought a window was open. Had to sleep with headphones on. Otherwise hotel is lovely and modern. Bed and pillows very comfy. Large towels. Free mini bar was great to pack snacks to have during the day.,8,4-Aug-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"Located close to several major tourist areas and two MRT stations for further journeys. Free soft drinks, water and snacks topped up daily. Pool on the roof is a bonus.

Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"The hotel is small and everything seems to be cramped together, the entrance to the restaurant and the entrance to the hotel is not obvious enough to the guest, visually to the public this loses its value. 

With all that said, the attention and service is tender and attentive. Rooms are well equipped and cleanliness to the 10! 

Overall enjoyed my stay because the management makes it welcoming and familiar, restaurants shops etc all around the corner something to offer. More publicity should be considered to boost up its value. 

I would return anytime.

This is not the place I would stay if I was planning on spending a lot of time in the hotel.  The pool was very small and awkwardly located.  The hotel was not near most tourist places and you need to use transportation.  Sometimes hot water was hard to come by.  However, since we spent most of our time exploring Singapore and were basically there to sleep, it was fine.",8,26-Dec-19,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),I liked the room and pool. It was in a decent location. It was more of a local area rather then a tourist spot but it was easy to get around from this hotel. We only stayed here one night and it was fine. At night it was quiet but during the day we tried to sleep a little and since our room was right next to the pool we were woken up by kids. Overall this hotel was nice and I may stay there again. I would suggest not getting breakfast here and going somewhere else. Breakfast was quite small and I would prefer to have more protein.

Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"The property was completely fit for my purposes with a (very) small pool with jacuzzi and sun loungers in a mini roof garden.  The room was fine for me, with added bonuses of opening windows (rare for cheaper Singaporean rooms), and free water, savoury snacks and biscuits given every day.  The property is situated near Little India, so close to restaurants and only a 20 minute walk from the city centre.  I will definitely stay here again if I need another room like this in Singapore.

On the downside - the room was tiny.  Only a single bed, no chair, and very little space otherwise.  I only required the room for sleeping, hence that was fine for me.  However, I can imagine anyone who needs to do anything more than just sleep in this room finding it too tight a squeeze for their needs.",8,12-Apr-19,

The rain shower head was a perk! I would warn future guests that the bathroom is pretty typical of those in Asia, where there isn't a door/curtain separating the shower from the rest of the room, so the floor and toilet can get wet (I'm used to this but I know that other Westerners often dislike this feature). I had a balcony on the sixth floor, although I don't think I'd bother with the extra cost next time. The pool and rooftop garden on the 5th floor was lovely! Very clean building and friendly staff.

We were initially told they could swap our rooms on Sunday (we checked in Friday) then later told it wouldn't be until Monday. My 19 year old son & I had to share a double bed which wasn't so bad but the see through bathroom was an issue for showering and toileting. Our fridge didn't work and despite telling reception three times it was not fixed. The room was tiny with no space to move. When we moved rooms on Monday to a twin room the room was much more spacious, the bathroom wasn't see-through and the fridge worked! A big improvement.

Should shift the check in time to early time instead 3 PM that I think is too late for check in. Where usually hotel check in time around 12-1PM.

The rooms are extremely small which does seem to be the case for a lot of cheaper hotels in SG. The room is in great condition however with comfy bed, hot shower and good aircon. 
Daily housekeeping is consistent and they do an amazing job! 
The staff on front desk don't really care... again this is a SG thing I think. Customer service is non existent, not even a hello as you enter and leave the premises. 
There are some construction works accross from the hotel which makes it sound like a war zone from 8.30am onwards. Not the hotels fault so we didn't cause any fuss but worth mentioning for people who want a lie in. 
All in all for the heavily discounted price we paid it did not represent good value, but it's very important to stress that hotels in SG are vastly overpriced so in hindsight for the same price you'll probably not get anything better. ",6,21-Nov-17,

This hotel is infested with ants. Not one or two ants but you can find at least 50 on the walls at any given time. 

Hotel staff were not shocked at all when we told them about the issue. We were booked for a two week stay and had to constantly change rooms because of the number of rooms filled with ants. They claimed to have called pest control for one of the rooms but we still found ants in the room the next day. Waking up to ants crawling on your bedsheets was an awful experience. 

The hotel staff was not accommodating. They would constantly say that they were fully booked and only offered another room when we saw rooms were available online.

Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"Location is great, close to the metro station and a short walk to a main road with all the buses you will need.
The hotel itself is not bad, looks good from the outside with a small swimming pool on the 5th floor which we didn't use cause it too close to 3 bedrooms on the side.
The room are very and I mean very small, a couple will struggle to find spaces with 2 big luggages. 
There is a nespresso coffee machine and complimentary mini bar with water and soft drinks.
The bathroom is again very small, and the shower tub doesn't have a door to close, so you will struggle not to spray water everywhere.
We had a serious problem with the cleaniless of the room, which smelt horrible, we found long hairs on the bed sheet and yellow stains, after complaining to reception they told us it was too late for them to do something so we had to sleep in a bed that was not changed from previous guest, next day again the same hairs where  in the bed as nothing was changed, again just an apology and some pictures taken and nothing more, I wouldnt call this a 4 star hotel, make sure you check your room as we had the same problem on our second stay, as we were on a round trip.
The rooms on the left side of the hotels are very noisy from the traffic so beware of this if you are a light sleeper.

Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),"Room is small. Upon check in, our room key would not work. After serveral tries and being sent back up by staff to try again, staff finally went up to try for themselves. They tried to fix the issue with no resolution. We were not offered another room. In fact, when we asked for another room, we were told no. Their resolution was for us to ask someone to open the door for us every time we wanted to go to our room until it was fixed. It was extremely inconvenient as we had checked in as a group and had planned to go back and forth between the rooms. There was only one front desk staff. And more than once I had to wait for someone else to finish checking in before getting into the room. We were not offered any compensation for the issues. When pushed, we were given a can of beer. While the door lock was eventually fixed, I do not feel that it was worth the hassle to stay at this hotel. ",2,15-May-18,

",8,17-May-18,
Hotel NuVe Urbane (SG Clean),This was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in 20 years of traveling (other travelers at front desk complaining about the same issue). It is impossible for two people to share a room as there is not even enough room to walk around the bed. The location is pretty far from everything and the terrace room where I stayed let's all noises from the street come in. The terrace is unusable by the way and as you half open the door it hits the corner of the bed. They should be honest and call the hotel budget modern because that's what it is. Even in Tokyo I've had bigger rooms for less than what I paid here. The pool is a nice touch but the chairs around it are reserved for the rooms that open onto the pool. I would recommend staying some place else. Oh and there are only 2 power outlets for the entire room. Good luck charging your phone and doing anything else that requires electricity.... ,6,18-May-18,

The guy that checked us in was a bit cold, but otherwise the other staff we interacted with were nice. We opted not to get breakfast included because we wanted to eat out in town. However, because of time restrictions we did went to the breakfast buffet at Ash and Elm on our last day. I was a but underwhelmed, I had heard good things about it, and was disappointed by what was offered. The selection is really only a step above your basic continental breakfast, and the staff were terrible at clearing plates. I ended up having to clear my tables plates because staff was no where to be found. I also suspect some of the food wasn't clean or kept at a safe temperature because my entire group felt ill about an hour later, my dad ended up vomiting just before we left. The hotel was nice enough to comp our breakfast, but even if we didn't get sick from it, I wouldn't recommend the breakfast. You can get much yummier and much much much cheaper food out in town.

On the sunny days you can lounge by the pool (with amazing views). They have a gym as well as an AMAZING breakfast buffet with so many choices (local cuisine and western breakfast).

The room itself is spacious enough, but I donât really like the design of their shower & toilet with its tinted glass doors. Buffet breakfast is awesome, taste delicious and lots of options.

When you pay so much for a room, you expect things to be right down to the details.   For example, why is it not possible to have decent coffee? How can this simple thing be so very difficult to achieve for a hotel that purports to be at such quality levels? You see the beans, hear the transformed before you, yet the end product is less than the worst instant. Yea, seems trivial, but it is not when you are spending more that USD 160 per night.

It's only a few underground stops away from the financial area of Singapore and the Marina Bay.   The service is very efficient. The rooms are relatively simple, but very well designed and functional.

Yesterday (7 Sep), a child (1-2yo) broke a ceramic cup during breakfast as she fell on the floor along the aisle. It is unimaginable if she had broken the water glass instead.

First, we have Mr. Sam, the chef who would be sharing about his travel experiences and his love of sports. Then we have Mr. Jimat who would be the man that makes my omelette. And then we have Mr. Yoges, the manager who would usher me to the seat while sparking beautiful conversations.  What made this unique was that they always had smiles on their faces and they were ever cheerful. It's just the one thing you could really embrace early in the morning.

We also stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights after being at Hotel Jen, and whilst the views from the pool at Hotel Jen don't have the same wow factor I would consider it a better pool to relax in, as it is far less crowded than MBS and the pool itself is every bit as nice.

So we needed to spray perfume to overcome it.  The pool may be the coolest pool in the world but it is just a plain rectangular pool. They probably won the coolest pool award maybe because it is located at the 19th floor, purified with salted chlorine which is  gentler on the hair, skin, eyes, and with a top city view.

The place is centrally located on Orchard Road (actually Somerset but you can access Orchard through the mall) and is ideal for tourists or business people with meetings around Ngee Ann city or the western part of the city. The rooms are spacious and we enjoyed having a great view up Orchard Road.

Room was not the biggest but certainly not the smallest - unless of course you are the sort who needs lots of space from your travelling companion.

In the lounge there were no glasses for drinks, nothing cold in the fridge and no food except a few nuts and a bit if tired cheese. When used to the Club lounge at any other Shangrila Hotel this is a disaster. The tables in the lounge were full of half eaten food and too many guests in all seats as well as standing.

The club lounge for Golden Circle members is awesome and provides a great selection of breakfast, snacks and pre-dinner drinks in a relaxing atmosphere. Hotel staff are awesome, efficient and friendly and used early intervention to resolve potential issues. The hotel is very kid friendly, with bouncy castles on level 10 on weekends and a 0.9M section of the pool.  The hotel robot Jeno is also a cool novelty feature using AI robotics to deliver items to the room, so that staff can focus on more complex customer experiences.

Hotel was close to the subway station and attached to 313@Somerset mall with lots of food and shopping choices.  At the ground floor the helpful bellhops stored luggage or arranged for taxis.  Reception was a short ride up the elevator and I was efficiently checked in.  Hotel restaurant was located here along with the smoking area which incidentally had a nice view.

The rooms are very well-designed. They are kept very clean and are very functional. Is this hotel perfect? No. But, what it has to offer is a truly nice lodging experience.  Not only are the rooms very nice in this hotel but it has other features to offer its guests, as well. One of the most notable is the infinity pool on the 19th floor.

Check in lobby is on the 10th floor and access to room via another set of elevators located on this floor.The room size was ok but the king size bed left small space to walk at the bottom of bed near the TV.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"My experience at Hotel Jen was a mixed bag. While on paper the hotel has everything a traveller needs it really falls down in the execution.   Starting with good - the hotel's location is excellent being located above the Somerset MRT and shopping centre. The check-in staff were very good and the pool is excellent. But things went down hill from there.  Firstly the hotel looks dated and needs a design refresh. It looks as though it was designed about 10-15 years ago. I looked up the opening online and was surprised that it was opened only 5 years ago.

Good comfortable bed, great shower and interesting wc. My only comment was the lay out of the Shower, WC, wash hand basin being all separate and by opaque glass. But that is a personal thing. Breakfast was very good,  great selection, good quality, with chef's on hand for omelette's etc.It can get busy but the staff kept the tables clear and turned around.

The breakfast offered is incredible. The selection on offer is like nothing weâve experienced before and gave us all plenty to choose from. If you have a day of exploring ahead then definitely get the breakfast option!  The room was large and gave us plenty of room as a family of 4.

It is just by the MRT and is linked to a shopping centre with restaurants, a supermarket and a food court. It is an excellent location for sightseeing, getting to the business district or shopping, with Orchard Road very close. Our room on the 14th floor was very clean and a decent size. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. Liked the way that although they provide bottles of water they encourage you to refill them from a machine on the floor providing water and ice.

Every other hotel we've stayed in you've had to ask for an Iron/ironing board or an ice bucket but Hotel Jen provided these in the room as a standard! Fantastic!  MRT station was just a lift ride down to the bottom floor which was incredibly convenient and we never had a problem with getting a taxi outside the front.

To be offered a drink at the bar for an unspecified amount of time or a late check out on my last day (sensing that is just moving the problem and creating issues such as mine) is not great service recovery.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"The hotel is situated in a busy business and shopping district right next to the MRT station ( same as the Tube but much cleaner and quieter).  On reading that you would be forgiven for thinking NOISE !! Not a bit of it. The hotel is peaceful,  clean, with well appointed rooms. From the inside would you have no idea where it was. The staff are attentive and friendly. I do not know her position in the hotel but Jeraldine seemed to be everywhere and was always ready to assist, quite literally from hailing a cab to cleaning up in the lounge.   The pool area was very pleasant in itself but completely monopolised by Australians morning, noon and night. We gave up after a couple of tryâs. As an exercise I went to the pool one morning before breakfast at about 9 am just to see the state of play. As I walked along the deck I could see towels strewn everywhere on chairs and sun loungers. There were two sets of three beds apparently unoccupied either side of one where an Assuie chap sat announcing to all comers â These are all taken mate â Perhaps readers can picture the scene.   The lounge area is very pleasant serving hot and cold food and free alcoholic drinks from 5.30 to 7.30. This was taken full advantage of to say the least by the same National group as at the pool. I can only assume they had never seen Gin, Vodka, Scotch, Wine or beer before, or they have prohibition in Australia   I would highly recommend the hotel if you want something clean and well situated for travel around the island.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"The location was the main reason we chose this hotel and it did not disappoint. Situated above Orchard Gateway shopping centre with Somerset MRT station accessed via the lifts, it could not have been easier to get around Singapore.   The room was not large, but adequate for our needs, with a comfortable king bed, plenty of drawers/hanging space & everything we could need provided. The curtains blocked out light extremely well and we found it very quiet, ideal for sleeping. The only minor drawback was the frosted glass shower/toilet doors in lieu of proper walls, but many hotels seem to be opting for this now. I do wish theyâd stop.   We had an issue with our fridge not working and staff could not have been more helpful, sending someone to check it within minutes of our call, and having it replaced in under an hour from our first reporting the problem. Check in staff were also super helpful. We arrived on an overnight flight and were able to access our room by 11:00am, for which we were very grateful. The breakfast buffet was very good, with a wide range of food which was replenished frequently. Mavis was particularly helpful, advising us on sightseeing options, how to get there, and which nearby bars didnât require you to take out a second mortgage in order to pay for drinks.   The pool is really lovely (with a great view) and although it can get quite busy, we were able to find seats in the shade each time we used it.

MRT, bus stops are located nearby, so it is very convenient to travel by public transport.  Unsatisfied part: 1. Our check-in process took almost an hour and the front desk staff was too slow in the check-in process. Although sometimes I was just wanting to ask a few questions because we are tourists, then I see 3-4 other guests waiting for check-in, but at that time there was only one receptionist and no one else came out to check if there were many customers is waiting or not.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"The  Jen is a good hotel in a very good location. Middle of Orchard road above an MRT station. Room (panorama with club access) was good and spacey. Room facilities were nice. Cleaning time is a bit late, and twice I âinterruptedâ the cleaning lady around 13:00 and 14:00) Again, too late. The hotel has a lot of families with kids and it can be noisy sometimes. Club facilities are good, but âfoodâ time is too short.",8,Jun-22,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Second time staying at this hotel. The first was years back, before COVID redefined travel and staycation. But happy to say that despite the years, it still well maintained and a good place for a family staycation.   The place still looks great and welcoming. Love the inclusion of JENO, the robot, to the team as it was fun seeing it in action at the lobby.  Food at Makan@Jen is still a good place for breakfast with its wide selection. Just find some of the combination strange. Example having Otak-otak but no nasi lemak. Omelette station with no diced pepper or mushrooms. But that is just me picking on the little things.   Service staff were fantastic, especially impressed with the front desk and the housekeeping team. Both were great at their job, efficient and super friendly.â¦",8,Jun-22,

The room is well design and bed comfortable. Cafe also serves great breakfast. Service could be better as expected from Shangri-La. Missing the warmth and smile that I am used to at other Shangri-La. The must visit is of course the sexy pool at the roof top which overlooking the Singapore skyline. They also have a nice roof top garden which is so peaceful for some quiet time and relaxation if you donât mind the heat. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay and will definitely be back.",8,Jun-22,

I believe these rooms should not be charged at the same rate. The beds were really big and comfortable.  2. The breakfast was always nice with a good choice and polite service.  3.

Itâs central and has its own access to the local trains - MRT  There are so many malls attached due to the hotel being in Orchard Gateway you need time to try them all for food! Shopping too.  Only a short walk takes you to Chinatown and Raffles plus Robertson Quay which is a lovely restaurant and bar area.  There is a robot called Jeno that goes sound cleaning the areas which is amazing!  The rooms are cleaned every day to a fantastic standard!  The breakfast buffet offers a wide range of options in a nice environment.,10,May-22,

We had to bring our own luggage up to our room, breakfast had a large selection however a lot of dishes were very bland, basic complimentary toiletries (only bath gel and combination shampoo and conditioner provided), club lounge  had only a little bit of food - unless you came early youâd miss out! Iâm room menu limited and only until 9:30pm.   Pool however was great, nice views of marina bay sands and pool amenities were clean including change rooms.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"We stayed at the Jen Orchardgateway for 3 nights as part of our 6 day/5 night stay in Singapore. We were travelling from India with our 2 young kids and had stayed in a panorama room.   We checked in on a Wednesday at around 1:30 PM after checking out from the Rasa Sentosa. The 1st thing you'd notice about this hotel is the stark contrast on the guest services. You will need to get your luggage on the trolleys at level 1 and take it right up to your room yourself. Check in was smooth and the staff was very quick on the system and checked us in within 15 mins of arrival.   The room was exceptional. We stayed on the 12th floor (1210) and the room was very spacious and comfortable and had amazing views over the orchard road. It even had a TV integrated with the bathroom mirror and a nice bath tub with a window overlooking orchard road. There was a day bed that my daughter could use as well.   The location was very strategic and one could take a lift directly down to the shopping floors below or to the MRT. The bus stop  was directly opposite on either side depending on the direction. You had plenty of shopping arcades all within walking distance and plenty of food options around. However, if you are looking for Indian food, you will struggle to find options around here.   The breakfast was a standard affair and the menu was almost the same every day. The spread was extensive but with majorly continental options. We had been spoilt by the breakfast at Rasa Sentosa and found the breakfast at the Jen very average.  We had access to the club as part of the room package. The club is located on the 19th floor and had great views all around. It was a nice place to chill and they offer pastries, bread and alcoholic beverages between 5 30 PM and 7 30 PM every day. Outside of these hours, the options were only some nuts and soft drinks. They also have a business centre with a few Macs and printers in the club.   The service was a hit and miss and they seem understaffed. My request for an extra blanket took more than an hour. We were even put on a 'staff are busy service other guests' message many times I tried to call the reception.   Checkout was smooth. We had to get our own luggage down using one of the baggage trolleys but we were helped by the staff to use the kiosk to check out quickly. As our flight was not until several hours later, we could leave the luggage at the concierge desk and pick it up a few hours later.  Overall, the Jen is a great hotel with everything you need at at fantastic location. Just keep a check on your expectations on the service and your will be fine with this place. â¦",8,Sep-22,

We The staff were welcoming and we were lucky enough to check in a little early. We were given wine and chocolates when they found out it was our honeymoon. Room was clean and comfortable. Shower and toilet are in two sperate 'pods' of frosted glass next to each other rather than a separate bathroom with a door.  Rooftop pool is really fantastic.

The pool area, the main restaurant and common areas were superb and couldnât be faulted.  It says a lot for a hotel restaurant when the general public queue for meals.  ",10,Dec-19,

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Not many hotels can be found in the strategic area of Orchard and Somerset but also with a price that's affordable. Hotel Jen Orchardgateway is definitely one of them. So lucky to found this hidden gem.  It's simply a self service hotel. Self service starts from the way you transport your luggage. Since I carried two huge luggage and other stuffs as well, the hotel staff was kind enough to deliver them to my room.  The room was small, but I think it's big enough considering the limited space in Orchard area. Everything is provided for our convenience, all in compact package.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Great stop over hotel for two nights. Was late arriving and were shown to a room with only two beds despite clearly specifying 2 adults and 1 child. This is a common theme with us!!! The hotel quickly realised our allocated room was too small and transferred us quickly. An extra bed was provided within minutes. We paid for the horizon lounge which was great to have. We were delayed landed and clearing customs which meant the car had an hour wait. The hotel quickly and efficiently negotiated the waiting removal from our bill.  Highly recommended hotel.,10,Dec-19,

There was an elevator which took you directly to the shopping center underneath the hotel however it took forever to actually come as too many people try to use it on multiple floors.  The pool is gorgeous and offers views of the Marina Bay Sands and the city.  Drinks by the pool were a little bit expensive, however not to expensive that it stopped us from having any.

The rooms had USB plugs so we didn't really need our electrical adapters.  The only thing comment I would share is that the shower steps into an open space in the room (not door between bathroom area and bedroom area) and the toilet is in a glass enclosure (you can hear everything) so if you are staying with non-so-close friends or if you have different gender sibling ... it may be awkward.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"While small, the rooms are good. But the bottom line is that the hotel is trading off the pool which was the highlight of the place. The breakfast was borderline inedible (for example the juices are all cordial), the reception could not be any slower and our 2 room booking was treated separately on check-in and out, doubling the time taken. The separate concierge on ground floor and check-in on level 10 gives the place more of a feel of an apartment block. For the money, I don't rate the place and would not return.",4,Jan-20,

The guest room we stayed in was clean and functional, however I was underwhelmed by it when I opened the door on the first day.

The location is amazing i.e. bang behind orchard road connected to MTR and also the orchard gateway mall. The staff members are super helpful and courteous.

Rather they had very limited options in all i.e. some pre-prepared items on the menu.   The breakfast spread was a bit disappointing too, that too on a Saturday morning.

I have to say the best aspect of this hotel is the rooftop pool (apparently named Winner of the Coolest Pool in the World this year) - great views and planted scenery make for a wonderful atmosphere. The room itself was small - which was fine, since I was only there one night - but decently outfitted. Shower water pressure was unexpectedly good, and the window bench seat made for a cozy atmosphere. The bed was comfortable, if a bit low. I knew Singapore is an expensive place to visit before I booked. However, I would have rather stayed at my preferred J.W.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"The Hotel Jen at Orchard Gateway is one of my favorite mid-range stays in Singapore. I recommend this hotel to friends and family who come to stay. The location is one of the best for tourists as its in the heart of Orchard Road shopping district and right above a central MRT station. The hotel facilities are amazing, award winning pool, nice lounge and restaurant. The beds at this hotel are some of the most comfortable ever! Fantastic view from the room of downtown, only complaint is a somewhat awkward room layout, with the wet areas (washroom, wc) not being entirely separate from the bedroom,  there is a sliding door but it doesn't nearly come all the way across, quite bizarre.",8,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"I stayed here for 3 nights and was very satisfied with my stay. The location is absolutely great on Orchid Road. I arrived at Changi, and made it to the hotel without getting outside. The metro leaves in the airport and stops under the hotel. The use of the metro is very easy for a foreigner.   I like the design of the hotel, the staff that works there, everything was great. Book a club room, or try to upgrade upon arrival. It is definitely worth it.    The highlight of the hotel is the pool if you ask me.   With no doubt I would stay here next time when I visit Signapore! ",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"My teenage son and I stayed here this week and had an amazing stay. The hotel is in a perfect central location surrounded by shopping centres and the MRT beneath the building. Our room was compact, clean and functional.  No doubt the highlight is the stunning rooftop pool, especially at night time. Being able to enjoy the atmosphere, have a drink and/or swim until 11.00pm is wonderful. The view of Marina Bay Sands is second to none.  All staff were professional, friendly and efficient. The resident robot Jeno is a cute novelty, which kids undoubtedly enjoy. Thank you so much.  We would not hesitate to stay here again on our next trip to Singapore.  ",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Stayed here for two and the hotel is well located. Just downstairs you are connected to Somerset MRT station. For conventions at a marina sands your only a few stops away.   Rooms are simple , clean and  comfortable. I choose it for location . ",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"This is a great hotel, located just above the Sommerset Mrt.  I have stayed here on two occassions, once with my husband and children, the other with my elderly parents.  Both times staying in a club panorama room.  This hotel has everything you'll need. The rooftop pool is beautiful with fantastic views.  The breakfast caters for everyones needs.",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"What an amazing hotel!  My sister and I spent several days there on business and used the room for work as well as relaxation.  It was well appointed and provided a good work space.  We appreciated the in room breakfast service that was included in our stay.  I think if we could ask for one improvement, it would be more consistency in bath towel service.  Hand towels were forgotten one day.  The floor mat another day.  That said, replacement requests were dealt with promptly and the staff is just excellent!  It will be our hotel of choice in Singapore from here out.  Thank you for hiring and training kind, professional staff and for providing a great location with excellent amenities.",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Hi,   Just wanted to share my experience. I was given a discount code to be used for the hotel and the price stated was 235++ in the brochure that was given to me. However, when I asked the hotel staff about the availability of the room, they quoted me 255++ and stated that 235 was for single occupancy. First of all, it was not stated in the brochure and hotels normally do not charge patrons based on the no. of occupants. I decided not to book a room from this hotel as I thought they were being dishonest and not transparent with their advertising. If they want to charge based on the no. of occupant, they should have stated in the T&C that the price is subjected to the no. of occupants.",2,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"First of all, it's at Orchard street, business and shopping area. You can access to the lobby on MRT level and Orchard gateway. So the location is very convenient. The cleanliness and service are super good. The only thing that troubles me is there is no private dry zone to get dress. If they adds a curtain or binder between dressing area and bedroom, there will be awesome.",8,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"We only stayed for two nights at the beginning of our holiday, but it was a great start. Room was comfortable. Slightly odd bathroom facilities in that little privacy or room to dry /get changed as mentioned in other reviews. Didn't get to use the pool but had cocktails up there one evening - amazing view over the city. Staff and service were impeccable. Highly convenient for shopping mall and access to metro. Breakfasts were amazing - one of the best and most varied selections of food I have ever come across",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"A very good experience and definitely highly recommended hotel especially for the family holidays! It was great to share with the family some memories of our life here 30 years back! Weâve booked the interconnected club rooms on the 20th floor, the Lounge, swimming pool and the bamboo room are located on the 19th floor so everything was really convenient for the whole family!  The view from our apartment was really nice and the pool view is just amazing! The F&B at the Lounge should be presented a little bit better, also should be available more variety (not only fruits and biscuits, tea, coffee and soft drinks) for 24h as advertised!

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"I have been to Singapore before but stayed with my son. So first time needing a hotel. Had shopped on orchard road last time, so knew it was a good spot to book. Hotel is right above the shopping centre and the metro station, called Somerset. So there is always something to do till at least 10pm, also you can always get food. Rooms are nice and clean, and really good value. Book breakfast when you book hotel, much cheaper, and good value, such a good choice. Pool is fab, and pool drinks and food good and the service, you have a buzzer. Easy to get taxis. So down load the grab app before you go, will save you so much money, than other cabs. Basic rooms are fine. Your not in there much. So not worth paying extra for. Use the metro, itâs like UK , get a card and charge it up forâ¦",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,This hotel was perfect for us. We had interconnecting rooms that worked a treat. The location is perfect on Orchard Road. The pool area is absolutely sensational. We spent most afternoons on the roof top having a quiet drink and a relaxing swim. It has great views out towards Marina Bay Sands. The reception by the GM (Julian) of the hotel was a lovely touch and the fun robot that delivers things to your room had the kids intrigued and excited. Greta shopping and food places underneath cap this hotel of wonderfully. I would stay there again in a heart beat,10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Next to Somerset MRT station. Rooms are well laid out with integral bathrooms lovely walk in shower with classy toiletries. Breakfast in bright room mix of international and Asian dishes but coffee from machine is bitter. Jen the robot visits each floor collecting rubbish and carpet in lift changes each day to reflect the day. Best feature is rooftop infinity pool and bar with city views a great way to cool down from heat and humidity. Would recommend.,8,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"I was excited about the pool.  Everyone is.  It was just what we hoped for.  I only stayed one night, and wish I'd stayed longer.  Swimming above the city was amazing.  The shopping district is right below you, and so convenient.  The staff are accommodating and friendly.  The room was lovely and clean.  I would definitely stay here again.",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"The arrival experience was a bad one. The lobby was crowded and there were only 3 receptionists handling the check ins and the queue went snaking around. The check in process was quite slow. Booked a room with king sized bed but was told at the counter that the room given will be a joined bed room. Well, we took it, nevertheless. But when we came up, its 2 single beds there. Absurd.  We were given a birthday amenities and are thankful for that. It was a small sized pail filled with chocolates and a balloon. Well, if u wanna give someone well wishes, do it sincerely. The pail was only half filled with chocolates whilst the other half of the pail is filled with plastic, so when they fill up the pail, it'll look full.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Iâve stayed in so many times in Singapore hotels; from 3 to 5 star ratings; so far, this is the best for its class. The location is excellent- next to food and shopping and subway. All amenities in the room is complete from toothbrush to variety of tea/coffee. I like the fact that there is water dispenser in each floor to refill your bottles and there is a food vending machine. If you arrive close to midnight and are hungry; 7-11 is very close by and there is 24 hr Japanese food store Dodonki? next to the hotel. ",8,Nov-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"We spent 10 days at this hotel to visit Singapore. The hotel is well placed, directly on an MRT (Singapore metro) station in the shopping street.

Next time I will pay little extra to stay in the Deluxe King Room type instead.  ,10,Nov-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"This hotel was incredibly comfortable, had a wonderful rooftop, and the MRT station was right below the hotel via an elevator from the lobby which was very convenient. It wouldâve been nice for the price we paid to have a breakfast included which is my only complaint. Comfy beds and wonderful shower.",8,Nov-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Such a great experience, from the moment we arrived (5am!) we felt provided for and taken care of, great to be able to use pool/shower facilities from the moment you arrive and also at the end of your stay post check out (which is awesome at 12 noon), the pool is the reason we chose this hotel and it didnât disappoint- particularly compared to the mad house that was Marina Bay Sands pool. The rooms were clean and quiet, great price and location is great too. Small touches added to experience such as mobile charging stations, water/ice stations in each floor with thermos in your room to use to fill up, luggage trolleys conveniently on each floor and room service robot. We would definitely stay here again if in SNG",10,Nov-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"When I go to Singapore I usually stay at Park Royal on Pickering; however, time I wanted to switch things up and try out another hotel. Hotel Jen on Orchardgateway is a great hotel in a great location. The hotel is directly above a mall which made things very convenient when needing to purchase items. The hotel has direct access to the mall and MRT from within the hotel.   The hotel had breath taking views of the city from the infinity pool and the staff was very friendly. I would stay in this hotel again in the future.",10,Nov-19,

We love the Chilling Hours in terms of the good food , quality snacks & itâs wide spread of alcoholic & non-alcoholic beverages. The Club Lounge is situated on the 19th floor & one may enjoy the nice panoramic view of the cityscape while enjoying the sumptuous breakfast. The ambience of the Club Lounge is super comfortable. We did a lot of casual readings & reflections during our stays there. This is the only Club Lounge that operates for 24 hours as compared to other Shangri-La group of hotels!

Recommend you try it at least once.  Pool upstairs is great to swim and lounge in. Having breakfast here better than the crowded restaurant downstairs. Great views of Marina Bay Sands especially at night.  Service was pretty good, especially the front desk. Very professional.  Room was just alright. It was functional, but furnishings were not quite 5 star. Stayed in a Deluxe room.  All in all a good hotel for the price and location. Wonât mind staying here again.  ",10,Nov-19,

I didnât get a room at first when I checked in, due to many people were having late check out in the afternoon for the long weekend holiday there. The staff offered me a free complimentary breakfast for their sincere apology and I got my room after an hour later. This is acceptable as they had immediate response to customer. ",8,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Enjoyed our 2 nights stay here.  Perfect location along Orchard Road.  The best part of this hotel is its pool on the 19th floor !!!!    Front desk was helpful and friendly.  We requested for rooms with connecting door.  I don't like that the toilet is separated from the shower.  There's also an ice machine near the elevator.    We also tried the buffet breakfast and enjoyed the variety of food offered.   I just wish they have more bread choices and fresh orange juice.  It's about SG$ 28/pax which is a bit expensive for breakfast but that's the rate you pay in a nice hotel.    The hotel is very convenient for MRT since it's part of a shopping mall and MRT station.  Easy also to grab a taxi because just the side of the hotel is a taxi stand.  Will stay here again.,8,Nov-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"My regular hotel when in Singapore. Always stay in a room with club access, which provides complimentary breakfast and even drinks and snacks - for a small supplement. Service is fabulous, rooms are small but well designed.

Nothing really wrong with it, all very functional but I do object to being woken up every morning by hoovering outside my room and coming down to breakfast to find most of the buffet has been eaten but won't be replenished. Always long queues at reception and little chance of getting a cab from the stand. The Fullerton it ain't! ",6,Jun-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Stayed for the second time at hotel Jen Tanglin for a night. Decided to do so as my memories of the hotel was very pleasant.  Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. Furnishings were modern and new.   Check in was smooth and quick. I never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a lift at any time. Even the lifts were decorated nicely! I was there with my daughter for a night and we had a good sleep on the comfy beds.   The bathroom was very clean and they provided toiletries including toothbrushes and hairdryer.   Breakfast was good too. They provided a vast variety of food with something for everyone. I never thought I would see my favorite bread and butter pudding at breakfast. Big bonus and plus point!   Check out was equally smooth and the concierge will assist with taxis.  Willâ¦,8,Jun-19,

They were in my suitcase, in my bed, and in my bedside water... I woke up and was given a new room, with food on the bed. Cleaner came and brushed the food off the bed. Has this new room even been cleaned? Finally it was discovered that the previous tenant had ordered lots of room service hence the infestation. No apology from the hotel manager nor cleaning service. Definitely need higher standards of cleaning please. ",2,Jun-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Booked the hotel for a birthday staycation over the weekend. My friend wanted to surprise me and requested the staff to place the flowers and the wine in the room. But alas instead of assisting her, they gave her the key to the room when the reservation wasnât made under her name. Didnât feel secured at all then someone can just check in on behalf without the actual person being present. The bathroom door was squeaky when opening and closing it. However the little disappointment was made better with the comfort of the room and nice dining experience at J65 although they did billed us erroneously. Hope the next visit will be a more pleasant one. ",6,Jun-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Stayed for a few nights on our way through Singapore. The rooms are quite small, but nicely renovated and practical. Great swimming area and fitness, steam room, sauna facilities on site.

Nothing is too much trouble for himself & the committed team of Natasha Tan, Sean Chay, Candy Koh, Afiza & Anand. A key success factor is that there is always a ""Go To"" person in the room, whether it is to sort out an AV challenge, reconfirm table configurations or revisit the menu.

This hotel is changing the paradigm of traditional hotel stays. Staff wear jeans, and the whole feel is relaxed. I upgraded to the club floor which was worthwhile. The room was spacious and modern with a window seat, lovely bathroom and basic but good bath products. The club lounge drinks included Ed and white wine and gorgeous canapÃ©s including fresh, chunky sushi. There was also afternoon tea and breakfast either in the lounge or ground floor - all Included.

They must have very quick turn around of the rooms, as the room has not been aired from the previous person. I have had blood stains on sheets several  times and when I have complained it takes to long for the staff to rectify the problem, sometimes times hours. The floors in the room need a good clean as ground in dirt and hair have been evident. If rooms were clean it would be an amazing hotel.  Staff are very friendly but really donât know how to handle complaints.",4,May-19,

We could then see the great views from both sides of the hotel. The girl at checkin was great, and very helpful. We only stayed for one night, but enjoyed the breakfast - lots of choice, and good coffee. The hotel was expensive, but I think this is the case for all hotels in Singapore, and it is in a prime location, so itâs not really surprising.

It also includes free calls home to selected countries. The club lounge has varied and tasty snacks and drinks. There is also an all day menu if you require more food.

No soy milk option for coffee or cereal. Spreads for toast, etc were limited to strawberry or orange marmalade, no egg cups for eggs. Dinner menu was extremely poor, so didnât bother dining in, and the seafood or lobster buffet is very expensive.

They gave us the key card for the second room and when we arrived it was still being cleaned.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"1) Appreciate that the room was upgraded but I did specify that we were celebrating my birthday and anniversary (nothing offered but am still ok).   2) Shared days before arrival that my wife is heavily pregnant and to allocate a room near to the lifts. The first room we got was 1122 which was simply the furthest room you can possibly give. Horrible.  3) Found a broken contact lenses on the bed = poor housekeeping. Photo shown to duty manager Joshua who either need a break or break from his monotone response to feedbacks.  4) Ordered milk with cookies but the latter wasn't delivered together. 2 staff had to call the room to 'confirm' it. Unnecessary.  5) Staff entered the room while we were resting! Last straw and the one that made me approach the front desk.  I left my contact number for the duty manager to call me but no one did.   Joshua - ""We tried calling your room but no one answered. We didn't call your mobile because we didn't want to disturb you.''     I did informed Nabila that we will be out for dinner and why would I provide you my mobile number if I don't wish to receive calls?

I could also observe that other guests were happy to talk with her, so i hope next time i check in she is the Manager.  During the night i could also talk to the frot desk staff and he was also very easy to talk to.  The room was clean, very good view, refrigerator, couch etc. all there with nothing left to want more.  Pool was very big in my opinion compared to other hotels i saw in singapore, however children should not be left alone at the big pool because of the dept. (there is Hotel staff there as well). Gym i did not try out, but from what i saw also all you need should be there.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"5 star hotel. But I would rate a 4.5. Checked in 7th Sept and out on the 8th.  The initial check in was 3pm and I arrived earlier at 1pm. Was served by Inah and she upgraded our room to a suite as my partner was having her bday!  1st Special shout-out to her! Thank you!  When we arrived our room, the interior was retro and we simply loved it! However, there was a huge fridge with nothing inside, which is kinda weird. The microwave oven is due for servicing as the numbering display is half broken and we were trying to figure what settings to configure to heat food up.  Suggestion: at least put some canned drinks to make it worthwhile for the electricity to run?  One of the key decision to book this place was the jacuzzi pool but was sad that:  1. We are unable to find it despite asking around. 2. It is not unisex. 3. It is closed at 8pm, so we didn't get to use it.  So we used the pool instead. The water is abnormally salty for X reasons, probably badly maintained as there are brown stains around the walls. We used the relaxation pool and the friendly lifeguard on duty was kind enough to show us to activate the function! Pool closes at 9pm so you will need to plan usage.  2nd Special Shout-out to the Lifeguard! Thank you!  Breakfast was okay and the cook/chef on the omelette station is very lively and friendly on a 8.30am. I was amused that almost all the staff had the 'angmoh accent' or voice change when speaking to tourists while there are food promoting on local flavours. Try to be yourselves to bring out the authentic experiences!  3rd Special Shout-out to the heroes on the F&B å¸å-s! Stay healthy, eh!  Services was kind of slow as the floor staff are mostly (or probably) tertiary students on part-time casual work, which is understandable as it reminds me of myself as a student as well many many years back.  What triggers me for not putting a huge solid 5 stars was the staff wiping the tables, is using the same cloth numerous times without any disinfectant; meaning probably spreading germs/dirty stuff/food remains on the whole (multiple) tables.  1. Huge spray was spotted at the serving station and I hope it is not just for show. 2. I saw a staff not sweeping food remains onto the floor but instead, collecting by hand and pouring it into their apron. (Not sure if can be questionable positive )  Since now it is post-covid period, perhaps, the cleanliness can up the game more and be improved, since even fast food Macdonalds have different cloth for clearing food remains and disinfecting tables. I would suggest, having latex gloves is good for starters.  Not forgetting the lounge, the food selection was okay. Kudos to the staff being knowledgeable for introducing what is being offered there!  After I left the premises, I realised that I left my favourite shorts in the room (yes, this is kinda weird for many for a Lost and Found). Called the hotel hotline at ungodly 1am trying my luck if they did found it. Sure enough, they followed up and gave back a return call!  4th Special shout-out to the Customer Representative that entertained my call and Housekeeping that found my item. (Apologies that I didn't got their names)  Overall, it has been a wonderful stay and I would be definitely coming back again! Other than relaxation for a staycay, I learnt something about excellent customer relationship should be, which I didn't understand much when I was a teenager.  P.s. (#1) Jenna the robot. Kinda interesting. Wondering what kind of technology is it running (either WiFi or Bluetooth to track movement around the place?)  P.s. (#2) if possible, the check-in timing can be earlier? Else people can't really explore what the hotel can actually offers!  P.s. (#3) it would be great if there is a page where we can send enquiry for lost and found item. I did a Google Search on Hotel Jen and found that Gateway premises have a page for it.â¦",10,Sep-22,

Staff are friendly, a SHOUTOUT to Nadia, Yen Yi and Celene for managing the lounge service well and with a very warm smile throughout the day.  Very good evening cocktail selection of finger food. If you are a light eater, it should suffice as a dinner.  The afternoon treat is a bonus considering the price point. But the staff mentioned above are still very warm and polite throughout, despite certain situations where there are larger crowd turning up (self entitled bunch) whom requested this and that throughout the afternoon treat (or rather, past 4pm).

Everything is fine with the hotel.  The staff were friendly and because of covid, I avoided using the hotel's gym and pool so I cannot really comment on those.  I did not eat at the hotel either though the evening themes looked interesting and the buffet looked tasty.  It should have been four stars but I have to take half a star away for a) clogged up shower and b) uncomfortable working table and chair.  Otherwise, its a lovely hotel and I will have no trouble staying here again for personal business trips.",8,Apr-22,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Enjoyable hotel at Tanglin.  Compared to Jen at Orchard, Jen at Tanglin is a much nicer hotel with proper hotel facilities (gym, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and club lounge).

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Stayed at this hotel when it was previously the Traders, now it has been rebranded to Hotel Jen we decided to have a 1 night staycation.  Arrived at the hotel at 1:30pm on Sunday 1st May and was met by a snaking queue of people waiting to check in. It took 35 minutes from joining the queue to eventually get the room key.  There Is a serious lack of urgency from the staff.  The rooms are nice, very clean and modern - no complaints at all about the cleanliness. The pool is also great, however on the second day it was busy and there were no large pool towels. We were given a hand towel and told to wait 30 mins.  Overall itâs a nice hotel but they really need to fix the service standards.",6,May-22,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Arrived early after a long haul flight with 3 kids in tow. Charged for an early check in then given keys to a room with two single beds. The website had stated this room sleeps 4. Given room size there was no room for an additional bed. After much argument the only 'solution' that the hotel manager could provide was for me to pay more money for a room upgrade.  The upgraded room was adequate although not overly clean. Buffet breakfast was again adequate, although not notable in any way, especially given the price. The swimming pool was nice until a child pooed in it. ",4,Apr-22,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Overall Hotel Jen is a good place to stay. I liked the proximity to the shopping malls, bed and linen are soft and comfy. I liked to be able to order room service or amenities through a chat after you scan a QR code. It is a bit flawed though as I ordered breakfast at the pool (you can choose a between room, pool, spa) and it never arrived. If some some reason they canât deliver the food, there is no one that let the order is cancelled, them just let you wait and figure it out on your own.  One thing that did make my stay less enjoyable was the ridiculously short pool opening hours. 9am until 7pm! I notice many guests myself included booked this hotel for swimming because it has a 30m long pool. But then I could not do my morning/evening swimming as the pool would open so lateâ¦",8,May-22,

I did not believe him and when I  checked further, I found out that they did not have enough staff to open the pool. I am very shocked that the duty manager tell lies to guests.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"So this hotel has become one of my favourites with its quirky decor and off the grid, but near enough location. Iâve previously left reviews of the place, and the wonderful staff as well. However, for this visit, there is a sense of exhaustion from the team. Maybe it is my imagination, but the staff looked tired. While they still greet you politely, during the days Iâve stayed here, it felt more perfunctory and lacked the old enthusiasm.   Anyway, compared to my previous stays, I had one of the tiniest rooms ever. The bathroom felt cramp and even the closet in the foyer is small. Anyway, this stay for me felt a little disappointing.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Recommended stay by our friend.  Our check in and check out is efficient and very professional with staff being friendly with out request.

We were very happy with her service and are grateful for your accommodation to the many last minute changes to our guest list and her prompt responses. Our comments from the food tasting were well reflected in the banquet, and food served during the banquet was even better than the food tasting. The herbal prawns and baby abalone are truly awesome! The set up was beautiful, tea ceremony and banquet went smoothly. It was a cozy and elegant ambience.   We felt that we were very well taken care of from the beginning when we booked to our hotel stay at the end. All in all, it was a great experience that we would recommend to our friends.

Not the typical with doorman with white gloves or with lobby of big floral arrangement. The hotel is casual with cool decoration.  We saw Jena, the robot and also got to experience her delivering our midnight supper. That was an experience, robot bringing food instead of a real person.  Room decoration is not exagerrated but it is well presented, the sofa by the window added a charm in the room because you have an extra space to laze around except the bed.  Process of check in was a bit longer because we can during peak hour there are lines but once we reach the Reception staff all was swift and we got our room key quickly.

As ABNB sadly isnât readily available in Singapore at the moment we decided to try the Jen Hotel in Tanglin for our seven night stay in early January 2020. We were generally very content with our choice. Initially we were disappointed that the room and bathroom were very small and that we were allocated a room looking out at the major building works just below.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"I stayed in the Premier Suite on 17 Dec.   The club lounge is closed but the hotel chose to omit the info when selling their club rooms and suite. The hotel continued advertising club lounge as part of suite/ club room perks, ostensibly to secure business with its reopening. At no point in the check in was this info even conveyed to me. I found out only when I asked.  The alternative to the club lounge was a simple tea set ( one cream puff and mini cake), which is a far cry from the usual club lounge food. Breakfast is also served at the common breakfast restaurant, with no attempt to offer any perks or alternatives.  So for those looking at club rooms and above, do reconsider if itâs necessary. You are paying at least 50% more for a standard room without much diff in amenities.â¦",2,Dec-21,

Much appreciated if the certificate can be displayed so that Muslims visitors are much assured of the Halal Authenticity. Overall, the food and services rendered are tip top.

For room service food , they miss some item very often, if requested to bring , the answer is "" today menu is like that"".  Front desk staffs are surviving on lies. Government must exclude this Hotel from quarantine list. I will inform our Government also about this hotel.

We went for it  and it was a great decision; breakfast was included in this and so was the lounge access (snacks and tea/coffee were available 24/7); this was great since we were travelling with a toddler. Also, the fact that the hotel is connected with the mall was an added advantage. The service was great and the buffet spread for breakfast was huge. The rooms are not large but very well done.

Rooms are relatively small, especially the bathrooms, but you get what you pay for, and we have no complaints in that regard. The pool is big and receives plenty of direct sun throughout the day, and the nearby gym is well equipped. We had breakfast at the hotel everyday of our 3 night stay and the range on offer was all that you could reasonably expect.

On the other hand, the Coffee House staff was great.  Chef Kim was like a bright sunshine.  Always smiling and making sure all the guests had a good and warm breakfast.

The bathroom is compact but more than sufficient with a roomy shower space and good water pressure. I wouldnât call it a luxury hotel nor budget. More something in between.

We view front desk service as the utmost importance since they are the face of the hotel and how they appear friendly and non judgemental can make or break a guests stay and many hotels we have been to fail this test. Ain who was perhaps one of the best front desk staffs we have come across managed to make us comfortable while waiting to check in. We were impressed by her customer service skills which are lacking these days.Often times we are met with a staff who will greet,smile and check us in like a memorized script but this staff made us feelâ¦",8,Aug-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Quite isolated for Singapore standards, hence the relatively low price; about 20 mins walk from Orchard MRT station which is closest. However Tangling mall is next door and has enough shops and food court. Our suite was good value for money; even a partly filled fridge donated by the beloved Jen ;-) Only a shower instead of tub is a bit below suite-standard. Great breakfast and friendly staff.",8,Aug-19,

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"We stayed for 3 nights - as a family of 5 we were provided with interconnecting rooms which worked brilliantly for us.  Our check-in experience was excellent and with a very early arrival at the hotel, we were offered the use of the leisure facilities to freshen up ahead of starting our stay in Singapore.  Despite an advance request for early check-in and the very early arrival, our rooms were not ready until well gone the published check in time and it took some chasing to get this. With a much needed rest required, it was further disappointing to find there was no third bed in the room - this was provided a little while later.

Upon arrival at 1am, we were informed when we got to the room that the room did not have a second bed for the child, instead, the child was expected to sleep with the two adults in the one bed provided!!!   Has anyone in the world ever heard such nonsense?  We were informed that if we wanted a second bed, weâd have to pay for it (SING$80 per night).  Our child slept in the shower area.  No apology, no call back the next day, no notes on file.  When we left a day early as the room was frankly unlovable for two adults and a child, the front desk person didnât even ask why as frankly, she couldnât care less.

The shopping mall next door can be accessed via the hotel.  The ground floor of the mall had a food court as well as a supermarket should you need them.  I found the walk to the subway to not be too excessive, it was probably about a 10 minute walk on a flat surface, we bought a 3 day travel pass which was worth it if you plan on travelling around the city.

The Tanglin Mall is directly connected to the hotel, and Orchard MRT station is about a 15 minute walk. The hotel is popular with tourists and appears to cater mostly to the leisure travel crowd.     We stayed for three nights, and since we arrived early in the morning, decided to opt for early check-in by paying a half-day rate. Check-in was quick, but I was a bit disappointed that the booking was not eligible for Golden Circle reward points, even though it cost about 200 USD per night, since it was done through an online booking site.

Itâs located well (a taxi to Sentosa island costs 10-12 as which is around Â£7) the rooms are small and clean but well appointed with anything you could need provided, the beds are very comfortable and the shower is fab! Our breakfast was included and there is an amazing array of different breakfast options to choose from. Staff are very friendly and helpful. There is also a laundry room in case you need it although a little expensive (same price as the previously mentioned taxi just to wash and same again to dry). Brilliantly quirky decor with lots of bikes everywhere. We would definitely come back overall a really enjoyable stay.",8,Jul-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"I visited this hotel many years ago when it was still called âTraders Hotelâ. This time my first visit with family. The hotel is conveniently located near Orchard road. The Tangling mall is directly connected to the hotel and offers a good food court. Our room was rather dirty, if not to say filthy. The whole floor was sticky and we found dust everywhere. Also our bed sheets smelled old. Maybe we were just unlucky but I recommend to avoid rooms with 3 beds. The breakfast was good however there was clearly not enough personnel. At peak hours they did to replenish the food fast enough. Bring a light jacket because the restaurant is freezing cold. There is a large pool but not enough sun shades - be prepared to fight for shadow space!  Check in and -out experience was good.",6,Jul-19,

More than an hour later, room isn't ready, so we were given a different room. Booked twin beds. Nope. Given a king sized bed. TERRIBLE START.

The tv has a good choice of channels. The rooms with a view of the pool are good, the rooms on the other side overlook a very busy road and if you are on a lower floor this can be heard in the room.

To be fair, I checked in at midnight and I was checked out the next morning so I didn't have a chance to really see what the hotel is like but from the face of it, I liked it... It probably deserve a four star if I was able to stay for a few nights.  Last note... the hotel is in a nice part of Singapore and is not as convenient as one would like.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"We stayed at the Jen Tanglin during a short visit to Singapore.  The reception staff is nice and courteous. They helped us to checkin to the hotel quickly.  We were given our rooms, which are nice, and have all the basic amenities. However, the rooms are a bit small.  We also used the swimming pool for a short while.  We had a good sleep as well.  The hotel breakfast buffet is decent, though not very good.",10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Enjoyable stay . Hotel was close to the gardens .  Staff were friendly and attentive to clients especially Rachael who has a relaxed and cheerful approach to clients . Club lounge was a good place to enjoy drinks in the evenings and coffees throughout the day . Although it can get quite rowdy in the evenings .,10,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"This hotel is in a great location for shopping, dining and site seeing (walking distance to the Botanical Gardens, and âhop on hop offâ site seeing bus).  The breakfast is wonderful. Great opportunity to try what other cultures call âbreakfastâ.  Didnât dine in because it was a flat rate buffet and price.   The rooms are very comfortable with good work space and closet.  The bathroom has a wonderful shower however the lighting over the sink area is horrible.  The single light casts a narrow, concentrated beam of light that causes significant face shadowing, making it very difficult to apply makeup. ",8,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"It all starts as you arrive great service , in fact exceptional front of line staff. We were on 14th floor, very clean, comfy, rooms. We discovered Tanglin Mall is attached to the hotel with great shopping and an incredible food mall that was very reasonable compared to a lot of food options in Singapore and great food!",10,Sep-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"I was received with a warm welcome, by the front office team. Swiftly assisted with an early check in we decided to add on the breakfast at the restaurant j65.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"I was staying (living) in hotel 2-3 weeks a month for the half of year. In general the hotel is quite good, rooms have everything for comfortable stay. The bed and pillows are hight quality. Housekeeping is very good. Swimming pool is excellent but area around it requires upgrade. The same applies to gym - equipment is quite old. There are 2 restaurants - one on ground floor and second on 4th floor. Unfortunately food in restaurant on 4th floor is mediocre and I would not recommend it. Second restaurant has much higher standard.  When you stay long some minor things can irritate within time - leaking shower cable or strange smell in bathroom. After week I had to request change the room as they could not handle that smell.  Avoid stay on 7 floor - there are always many youngâ¦",8,Oct-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Always a good hotel accommodation. With friendly staff specially on check out I was assisted very fast for bill and also taxi assistance. Singapore by far is full of efficiency. Room was good not spacious but it was okay since I travel alone.,10,Sep-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"A very good hotel, also great value. Good location and very quiet too.  A central location, with friendly staff.  The lounge offers great food in the evening and a superb breakfast.  Iâve stayed here several times on business, and have been charmed by the particularly professional, yet friendly vibe of the lounge managers.  vanne always has a warm welcoming smile and is eager to ensure that your stay goes as perfectly as is possible! Thank you Vanne and ALL the lounge staff :-).",10,Sep-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Excellent hotel and it was a comfortable stay. They have a well decorated and warm guest rooms. Amazing breakfast service and food selection.

The frontdesk team are amzing with their great assistance and hospitality.,10,Aug-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"A good hotel with excellent service in Orchard Road. Rooms start to be dated but they are still very nice, as are the common areas.   We opt to take Club Room on arrival and it was a good decision with a cozy Club Lounge and cocktail hour.  Lovely people we meet and they serve us with pride of their job.

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Decided to choose this hotel over the nearby hotel.  First because price comoarison is better abd it is oart of famous Shangri la brand.   Did not regret it as we enjoy our overall stay.  Room is comfortable with nice decoration.  It is cozy and we enjoyed our stay.   Another area that i want to highlight is the helpfulness of the Frontdesk.  I made an extension booking and they cater for me to remain in the same room.,10,Aug-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"Staff polite and helpful. Afternoon pool lady was wonderful. Comfortable beds, shower great. If you don't book breakfast in hotel when you book in the price doubles from 22 dollars to 40+ dollars. Eat breakfast in Tanglin Mall at Beviamo. Eat dinner in The Food Hall in the Mall. Only complaint. We were not told about free shuttle bus to town. Would have saved us a lot of walking.  Also staff not aware that you can pay your bus fare when you get on the Hoppa bus. Quite honestly it's quicker and cheaper by taxi or metro to get around. Hanging around in the heat for next Hoppa was debilitating. ",8,Aug-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,"This hotel is top notch when it comes to service. I could not comment enough about it. I commend the check-in staff, concierge and even the cleaner in my room.   Everything was wonderful and definitely come back!",10,Sep-19,
JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,I would like to share that this hotel left me with a WoW. In service and staff. Everyone seems to be very friendly and welcoming. Staff at frontdesk always left a conversation in a day every time i drop by.   I had little inquiry on the place for first time and the concierge staff (indian) was so knowledgeable with the place.   I love everything about this hotel. Excellent!,10,Sep-19,

JEN Singapore Tanglin by Shangri-La,Amazing staff with genuine passion at work! I can see all that I encountered was all very helpful. When I arrive early morning room was not ready I refused to pay extra charges but the staff was kind enough to offer me alternative while Im waiting for my room. They had a lovely health club which you may refresh and relax in their sauna or steam.   I also love the design and the size of the room. Just all I wanted from a transit.,10,Sep-19,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Their accommodation is great; Comfy, nice bed, great room designs. But their service needs a lot of improvement: 1) housekeeping done at 10pm when it was requested at 10pm-they said housekeeping will be done after 6pm but came back at 9pm, room is still unclean; Called them at 9pm and they said some of the rooms still not cleaned and need to wait a little later for them to come clean my room. 2) took their time when requested for something-requested for a towel but they need about 28hrs to deliver it. Overall, everything is great-place is great, staffs are friendly and nice. However they really need to work on their effectiveness.",10,6-Oct-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"It was enjoyable overall, loved the room ' s layout and design. The only thing was that there was a musky, damp smell in the common elevator up to our rooms. We were thankful to the front desk who helped us with our early check in, however we were told to approach the restaurant when we requested for ice. Other than that happy with the stay.",10,22-Sep-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Stay was comfortable to a certain extend. First impression was the hotel is rather old. Corridor is very dark. Room is not as nice as portrayed by photos. The bed is very comfortable. One of the best I have experienced. However the pillows given were very smelly. We requested for a change and yes they did change for us. But this round with pillows strongly sprayed with lemongrass flavoured perfume or something. Shower pressure was good except that the temperature is a little inconsistent. Breakfast was OK. Limited variety but good enough to fill the tummy. Overall, with the price, I will not consider this place.",3,8-Jun-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Cozy and clean space. Bed is comfortable and toilet is clean.,8,3-Jun-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),I was given complimentary check in but still had to wait for the room due to high frequency I had called 2 days before my visit and they could have told me about it instead of me going there early and waiting for my room and had to keep asking the staff when it will be ready. The aircon wasn't working very well despite having them to check. But I had a late check out. It was my 3rd time staying there. Will probably not return here anymore.,10,18-Aug-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"I was so skeptical about this place as I only read the reviews after booking. I was prepared to wait for several hours to check in as mentioned in several reviews. But it took just 10min to be in my room. This place really need a good review. The room was awesome the only small set back as mentioned was the toilet being small. But it was not that bad. The service was good too. Wen request to have the room cleaned, it was done very efficiently. Definitely a new and nice experience to stay in a loft room. Kudos to all!",10,10-Aug-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Great customer service. And a nice room!,10,13-Aug-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Stayed at alcove cosy queen room. It was a comfortable stay and have all the basic ammenities. Front counter staff was friendly. Just that there are no bidet and no netflix. The TV channels are not a lot as well.,10,30-Mar-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"The check in took us almost an hour because there was a long line of customers but only 2 counter staff. And one of them was serving other customers who came in randomly at different timings and constantly to settle issues like pool cards returns, check-outs, enquiries etc and wat not. And the time it took for each customer to finally complete a check-in process took at least 110 min. We also only found out at the counter that the car park was chargeable at crazy prices and confusing options, which we were then later offered a cheaper option to buy an entry pass at $ 10, which I think it's a complete rip-off.",3,16-Aug-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),It was a night stay for my birthday. The hotel was very nice to give me a free dessert. Early check in and late check out was arranged and they are quite flexible with other requests. The staff are professional. Everything was good except that the whole place looks really dim especially at the walkway to the room and it took a while to figure out how to wind down the blinds.,10,8-Aug-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Very comfortable for short stay ,8,24-Oct-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Check-in queue was long but understandable due to the staycay trend. Had to queue to register once outside and again inside. Staff handling the registration outside was nice but the frontdesk looked like she had a bad day. 

Once we got to our room we got a shock because it wasnt made up at all. Was about 4 - 5pm when we checked in. There were pizza boxes in the room and pillows were on the floor with used towels. Waited for abit to talk to the staff at the entrance since frontdesk was still occupied. She changed our room and told us there was an error in the system. She also gave us a complimentary breakfast for 1 morning. Did not want to leave a bad review initially since the industry took quite a hit from covid. But there seems to be negative news on the hotel from the recent power outage. I feel like there might truly be an issue on the management and I want to warn future guests. 

Room itself was small but cosy, design was nice and breakfast was decent. Location is not the best, long distance to public transport. No complimentary parking.",6,21-Dec-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"The rooms were nice and ok, but there were little flies in the room and on the pillow... which puzzled me. Used coffee capsule fr previous guests was not cleared and the machine was not cleaned. Otherwise the stay was nice.... but it was marred by the post stay experience of us trying to retrieve a soft toy left behind by my child. We were at first quite confident of getting it back as this is not overseas hotel and it is not a valuable item to others. Tried to call the hotel multiple times the next morning after check out but nobody picks up the phone throughout the day! No choice so i left messages in facebook and instagram and was left to wait for response. We couldnt wait and made a trip down next day. But was told it was not found. A bright green toy left behind in the room... but nobody seem to see it... was it dumped?  My child was devastated. ",6,20-Dec-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Room was clean but was hoping when then indicate there is items can be used such as iron board is available in room rather then gonna ask fm hk but upon calling,  they r only available after 8am which hope in future at least its available at frontdesk for guest to collect n borrow it.

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Hotel room was clean and well maintained. Relatively new hotel in good condition. The area has many bars and restaurants that will spoil u with choices. Check in early to avoid long queue but resulted in early check out too. ,10,18-Dec-20,

Location is really good which makes us to consider for future stay. ",8,17-Dec-20,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Walls are very thin. Room is very small. Impossible to reach the front desk.,4,28-Oct-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"This is our 3rd time staying in M Social within a year, which sadly will be our last. The service staff seems overwhelmed by the recent surge of staycation volume that they simply forgotten to keep up with their hospitality. The landline to the hotel is certainly like non-existence. Though the location and its nearby food offerings were the main draw, we certainly will choose another hotel which will be more worthwhile. ",4,26-Oct-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Hotel was reasonably appointed and most of the staff were fantastic. Understandably, during covid some changes are to be expected, but some things are expected of a hotel, such as the provision of ice. Every other guest I talked to tried to also get ice from the hotel but was told there was no ice machine, or to go to the attached restaurant to ask, wherein they promptly told everyone there was also no ice. Manager didn't see the issue with telling people to go and buy ice from 7/11. 

Breakfast was from the restaurant was poor and extremely slow. However, the food provided to outside customers actually looked quite good. 

When in tried to ring down to reception, we noticed the phone was not plugged in, not was there any power attached. 

We stayed in the loft room. Largest bed was a double, not a queen. Quite small for 2. Otherwise bed was super comfy, sheets were good and the room itself was quite stylish. 

Only provided 2 coffees per stay, even though our stay was for 3 nights. Felt cheap. ",6,9-May-21,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),the staff is indeed great! all are very helpful and cheerful! the room is nice!,10,20-Nov-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Pros: Good location and an ok experience if you like loft styles room.

Cons: Corridors and rooms were not well maintained and the lift and room has a weird burnt smell. Bed was cramped, not queen size and the pillows were square shaped and not comfortable. Worst thing was the breakfast where everything came out cold including soft boiled egg, bacon and kaya toast! Selection was also limited compared to other 4 star hotel buffets. To top if off, when we requested for late checkout, we were told this ""type"" of room didn't have late checkout. For the price paid, would not recommend a stay here as there are definitely better options out there. ",4,17-Nov-20,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"It was very nice - super quiet !
We requested a Iphone cable but wasn't available but the reception kindly kept our phone to chare over night. Super nice staff and comfort. We would have loved to be upgraded as it was our anniversary. Super clean and quiet. ",10,20-Apr-21,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Nice, cosy and friendly.  I stayed for a week and will say the facilities (gym, pool, bar) were excellent as was the room.  My only comments to the hotel are... 
1. Fix your chromecast option on the TV
2. So many of your channels were not active or unsubscribed from the provider.
3. The rooms are small, so having an autoshut toilet door right up against your nose makes it smaller.  
4. If you are going to run a contest on your keycards, at least ensure your staff know about it.  There was some blank faces when I answered the Q and then they spent 5 mins figuring out what I had won.  ",8,21-Apr-21,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Loft design is rather unique.  Otherwise, nothing too special about room space and layout.",8,27-Mar-21,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),The front desk staff is terrible and not well trained. More like interns. Horrible. Made me waited out the lobby for almost an hour trying to find my reservation. And when the lady told me i could enter to check in i still have to wait to check in because only 1 counter was open. When it is my turn the staff told me again i got no reservation and asked me to wait again and went in the check again. I was so piss off i just went to told her that she and ths hotel is wasting my time and totally turned me off on this staycation. DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED. ,2,25-Mar-21,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Overall, the stay is nothing special. Points to note - edges of furniture are sharp (e.g, bed frame) and thus, need to be extremely careful around it. To share my experience, a slight brush along the edge of the bedframe left me with a cut (see picture). Despite alerting hotel staff of my injury, the staff took no further action - disappointing. So, if you have kids, or are not as careful as me, I'll not recommend you to stay at M Social.",4,28-Feb-21,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),We had to wait for 1.5 hours just to check in! Imagine you want to have a staycation after working all week and you had to stand and wait that long JUST to enter. I paid so much for that loft room to wait so long. First time to experience such that we have to Q twice just to get a key card.  Staff are also unprepared during CNY- you know there will be a lot of people coming in and you are obviously understaffed that day! We dined at Beast and Butterflies and oh my goodness they took 45 mins to 1 hour to completely serve our orders. We almost left! Breakfast was horrible - the staff dont even know which order is which! She went round and round asking if this is your order or not. Did you not have any table number assignments AT ALL??? This is entirely an IRRESPONSIBLE management. The pool and other amenities are all average. Not hotel-like ambiance at all. ,2,21-Feb-21,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Hotels.com offered multiple benefits including late check out and complimentary drink coupon for the stay. However, upon checking in, the staff were rather unpleasant in checking us in, not explaining the amenities, or even mentioning the room number before passing us our cards. We also had to ask for late checkout at which they told us it was based on availability. We also had to ask for the drink coupon which was left out",6,5-Jan-21,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"There was a long queue to check-in during our stay and it seemed like the hotel was very understaffed during this peak season. We had to check-in twice, one outside the hotel entrance, the second time inside the hotel, at the counter. 

The gym has to be reserved in advance to be used and only a small number of guests are allowed inside. We didn't manage to use all the amenities in the hotel. 

That said, the room was nice and cozy. The location of the hotel was great and convenient to navigate around to town area.

There's no room service although the in room signage communicates so. Service staff called asking me to pick up my food order, imagine my surprise!

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"It was really disappointing to see how the reopening of a Hotel after the COVID-19 CB Closure was. Check in starts at 2pm. When we arrived at 4.50pm the room was not ready. We were given the room only at 7PM. Staff gave us ""complimentary"" drinks coupon as a compensation but the reality was that this was part of our package as VIP members on Hotel.com. No one bother to call us when the room was ready thus we were left sitting like fools in the hptel restaurant. There were avail rooms for upgrade when we checked in but DON'T bother as they will keep the rooms for prob paying guest the next day. They will apologise but that is the end. Bed was really small. The measure is 140cm x 190cm and pillows are square in size to make beds look like it is a double sized. Really horrific experience for a Singapore Hotel under an imternational Chain. Experience was so horrific that it sparked me to write my first ever negative review. Stay at your own discretion. Electrical sockets were all falling out of place. Never had that experience with the other chains like Hyatt or Sofitel group.",2,6-Aug-20,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Waited very Long to check in. When I enquired about my check out timing(which I had VIP excess, means my check out timing was two hours later) the reception said my check out timing was 11am and not 12noon.

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"This is our 2nd stay with M Social, picked the Premier Loft due to our previous pleasant experience & it was near the locations for our pre-wedding shoot. But this time round, we're disappointed with the cleanliness & service level. 

We checked in at 1:30pm. Standard check in was 2pm, check out at noon the next day. I was then informed we need to check out at 11am due to some 20-hour rolling policy. But I checked in at 1:30pm, so shouldn't I have at least until 11:30am to check out instead? 

In room, the sink & soap holder has leftover hairs from the previous guests. There were many finger prints on the flush buttons in the toilet. The coffee machine water tank wasn't emptied and we had to wash it ourselves. This definitely wasn't reassuring especially during COVID. But we were rushing to prepare for the next shoot so we couldn't afford the time to change rooms.

At night, we tried to contact the front desk and the M Ambassador for extra shower gel. Supposedly 24 hrs? No response at all after a few attempts. 

Overall, the Premier Loft is a wonderful and comfortable room to relax for a staycation. We like the way the bed is separated on the upper loft.",4,11-Oct-20,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"The queue for the check-in was long but understandably due to covid and extra measures required. However, would recommend to have more than one temperature taking machine/device available to facilitate temperature taking. 

Cleanliness of the hotel was not what i expected, there was still some hair and a hair tie left behind by the previous guest. The kettle was spoiled and i requested for a replacement. 

All in all its a simple, fuss free staycation, however the cleanliness would need to be improved.",6,5-Oct-20,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"The kids love the loft room which allows them to have their own cosy corner on the upper deck. They spent most of their time there. Would be nice if there is a sofa bed instead of just a normal sofa. There was a long long queue at checking in so the staff took our name and booking numbers and called us when the room is ready. Checking in time is supposed to be 2pm but the room was ready at around 3pm. The hotel gave us a late checkout at 2pm. Overall, this was a relaxing staycation and our kids hope to go back to the loft room again! ",8,15-Sep-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"There was a long queue to get to check-in at M-Social. The queue took almost an hour to clear and thereafter service crew would inform you that waiting time would be at least an hour as they are working to get a room for everyone. Having been to M-Social a few times, there's always a check-in issue whereby queuing would take alot of time. The rooms are cool though. Check-in procedures honestly need improvement. ",4,14-Sep-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),The waiting for check in is so bad. Waited 4hours for check in,6,12-Sep-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Went during Sept school holidays. Can tell that they were severely understaffed because queued 1.5hours just to check in. Could have staggrered check in time & let guests know before arrival. But the staff themselves kept up their professionalism when serving guests. Rooms are small & not sound-proof but the bed is super comfy. Peaceful rest. Insufficient pool towels and safe distancing/numbers of pool users not monitored probably due to lack of staff. This hotel seems inequipped to operate at max capacity, but props to the staff who gave their best nevertheless.",6,11-Sep-20,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Staff was good and responsive despite the crowd. Check-in was delayed for over an hour as rooms wasnt ready. Despite the posting listing complimentary parking and late check out, none of these came to fruition. ",6,10-Sep-20,

The complimentary breakfast was really good and offers a variety of selection from Asian to Western food. ",6,27-Aug-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Bathrobe is very comfy. Breakfast is good for a pax. There are pest issue in the rooms level 2 and 8.

The breakfast buffet is not worth it. Flies all over the fruit and an automated machine that makes horrible omelets. 

The only thing going for it is the location. ",4,19-Jul-22,

For the price I've paid, the property was disappointing.",4,19-Sep-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),Nice hotel with great location. Staff were very helpful. Room/bed was comfortable but room was pretty small. The location of the hotel was 10-15min walk to the train but the riverside walk area was very nice. Lots of restaurants on the river.,8,23-Sep-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Seemed basic and quite dark, but the swimming pool was very nice",6,24-Sep-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"I stayed at the loft room which is very decently priced. The sitting area comfortably accomodates a party of four. One will be able to sleep very well with the high quality bedding provided. However, I could only walk sideways when manouvering around the bedroom. The bedroom will not have any space for your luggage, or anything else for that matter so save yourself the trouble of lugging anything up. Also take extra when using the basin which is located under the stairs, outside of the bathroom, especially when you are tall. Might just bump your head on the stairs. There is no room service but there is a really nice restaurant, Beast and Butterflies, on the ground level.",6,8-Apr-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"Lobby is small and long lines for access to reception. Rooms are small but interestingly designed. Would have been a nice enough accomodation in its earlier days but looked a bit tired and quite dirty in areas. No iron in the room, the ironing board that was delivered was broken. Staff were friendly and attentive but a little overrun. ",6,28-Mar-22,
M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"So I dropped my bags off at the hotel for the hotel to store them, due to me being there a few hours before check-in. The front desk clerk ticketed both my bags and gave me the receipts for both. When I returned at check-in, it was discovered that the hotel had allowed another guest to take my bag. The managers asked me to give them time to sort out the issue and I did. My bag was located and returned to me FOUR hours later; nothing missing, but still a major inconvenience. I was offered no type of compensation rather than a few apologies. My room had many loose hairs scattered all about the room and the carpet was dirty. The refridergator had liquid stains throughout it and the windows were smudged with finger prints. I had to return to the front desk several times due to my room key card not working at random times after leaving my room. For the price that I paid, my experience was pretty sub par. ",6,5-Sep-22,

M Social Singapore (SG Clean),"- Check-in was terrible- had to wait in a long queue for 45 minutes outside the lobby. It was a very warm and humid day and there weren't any fans outside. Queue extended from the lobby all the way to outside the hotel property.
- Checked in online a day before my stay. It's useless and a waste of time. I still had to queue up and had to do the check in process at the counter- which took another 10 minutes.
- No safe distancing measures outside the lobby while in the queue to check-in (no markings on the ground etc).
- They seem to be still largely unprepared to handle check-in crowds. Meanwhile, other hotels have implemented staggered check-in times to prevent large crowds and an unpleasant check-in experience.
- TV was glitchy, especially when using the Chromecast function, almost impossible to watch content till the end.
- Bathroom door was heavy and almost impossible to properly close or lock.
- Requested for an ironing board- it had burn marks and creases.

Just like many beautiful couples who might be torn between choices, MO Singapore have us sold when we meet up with the PIC to go through the package options that they can offer, besides the good location.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Recently completed a 1 night stay here. It was enjoyable, however I felt overall I paid too much for the room.  Starting with the positives: - Great location, couldn't be better. Great views of the Marina Bay - Amazing staff, really friendly  - Superb breakfast (so much choice and really good quality) - Excellent fitness centre and swimming pool facilities  Negatives: - I was really excited for the room type I had booked, however it seemed really dated. It wasn't the cleanest too on arrival. It seemed like rushed. The rooms are becoming dated and should be renovated - I felt the rate paid wasn't worth it which was disappointing ",8,Jul-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","When booking the hotel room, I indicated that I wanted to have a good view of the fireworks from the NDP rehearsal. The staff emailed us suggesting to get a room with Marina Bay View instead of Ocean view. I appreciate the proactiveness of the staff. We had a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay & the fireworks!   Also, when we entered the room, they left us wine/champagne & some kuih. We can't consume it so we called the staff to have it back. We didn't expect them to apologise and replace it with chilled orange juice.  Also, even though the restaurant do not have halal option, there are many halal certified restaurants and fast food outlet at Marina Square just beside the hotel. It's very convenient.",10,Jul-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Perhaps it was because the breakfast host remembered our names and greeted us like she was so happy to see us.  The breakfast was perfect.  The view was legendary.  Could be the location.  MO was 5 star.  There are only 4 hotels to choose from: Marina Bay Sands, Fullerton, Pan Pacific and MO.  Everything else is too far away, too close to the shops or too busy.  MO is a great choice.  Some small foibles.  COVID has left hotels empty and a bit musty.  Some equipment not working.  All requiring patience as we all re-build.  The new complexity is cash.  CR Card has a charge on top of the charge sometimes and in no discernible pattern.  Consider WePay or ApplePay or cash.  Itâs been a while since I used cash but itâs hanging on here a little.

Can see hotel is earth friendly by giving water in glass bottles and shampoo/bath foam in dispensers. Breakfast is delicious and swimming pool is great.  Love it that there is no need to book timings for breakfast and swimming pool.  Accessible to nearby shopping malls.  Only small issue was the heater in our room, hard to operate as it is not intuitive.  Water took forever to be warm, then would become overly hot, then cold after adjustment.

The hotel has the appearance of its late 1980s build date but is clean and renovated I believe 20 years ago.  Our suite was to accomodate my wife and I, and three small kids.  Our first suite had two singles, and two foldaways -- a mix up and odd configuration. They fixed it but we slept in this room one night.

MO is conveniently located across the road from Marina Bay, within walking distance to major attractions such as the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands.  What the lobby lacked in terms of wow factor were more than made up for in terms of friendly service, be it door staff or those at reception/concierge. Check-in was relatively prompt (approx 6:30 pm) however we were told that several hours earlier the line was significant.

The staff were all wonderfully friendly and helpful. We made use of the included bikes to explore the coast. They really hit the mark with all the little details - like healthy snacks for our ride and the hydration stand at the front for when you go for a run.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","We stayed at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore earlier this month. Although the hotel seems very packed but all of staffs that we met was absolutely amazing.  The room was magnifique! We got a Marina Bay Sand view which made our stay even more memorable.  The housekeeping team was on point â our room was tidy and clean in daily basis. On the first night we called and requested for an extra blanket and pillow as we are traveling with little one, we waited around 5 minutes or less and got them at our door already! We went to many hotels and mostly we would have to wait longer - that was impressive !!   Breakfast was full of choices! Although there was a queue during Saturday and Sunday but we didnât wait that long because staffs were tentative and well-manage.  Special thanks to Debbieâ¦",10,Sep-22,

The senior manager of the event management, Roger is very accommodating to all our reasonable requests from day one to the day itself.. The operational manager Daniel, on the day itself was just as helpful and even make last minute adjustments to our table arrangements which we were very thankful.  Feedback on food was good and more than sufficient. The fish was fresh and the desserts not too sweet.  This is the type of service we would not hesitate to return in future. The staff made everything so smooth and easy for their guests. Also not forgetting those in the kitchen and service staff - A Big thank you! Keep up the great job Mandarin Oriental !!",10,Sep-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","We already stayed in many MO hotels over the world but this one purely lives off the reputation of the chain name. Rooms look shabby and unrefurbished and give the feeling of a 3 star hotel but the price per night is very expensive. The service was very not up to standard, the room was cleaned poorly and drilling works at 12 oâclock at night were the cherry on top. The first night we had a fish that was super smelly and we couldnât eat it and went to bed hungry. The room doesnât even have a coffee machine, thereâs only a water kettle and a sachet of instant powder. Really nothing is right about this hotel except the view. Whenever we complained we just received a shy sorry. Such a rip off this place, wow!",2,Sep-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","My cousin and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental hotel for 5 nights and was blown away by the service and hospitality of the staff. We stayed in a Marina View room which did not disappoint and I looked forward to going back to the view every night.  Every morning and evening it was such a pleasure coming to the reception area, as the stuff were so welcoming. Thank you to ALL the staff at, we had an AMAZING STAY.",10,Aug-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Was at Mandarin Oriental for a 2 days business training. Alice was assigned to our room and was always friendly and helpful, ensuring everyone had coffee and tea. Impeccable and warm service. Could tell Alice was very passionate about her job. Highly recommend if considering for corporate events.",10,Sep-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 3 nights in May '22. We had booked into the City Suite and when we reached the hotel around noon to check in, we were told the room wouldn't be ready for another few hours, and we were given a base category room to freshen up. But the room was ready only around 6 pm, which was okay with us since were out exploring the city till late evening. When we did enter our room, we found that the AC vents in the room were very unclean, and the room carried a musty odour. This was around 10.30 pm, and we were completely exhausted. It took more than one call to get someone to come to the room and attend to my complaint. A few more minutes later, thankfully, a slightly senior member of their management team turned up and attended to our concerns, and was able to offer a better room. I believe her name is Maggie/Margaret. She was definitely understanding and even ended up upgrading us to a Bay View Suite, which we really appreciated. Maggie (I really hope thats her name - I had written it down somewhere but dont have that slip anymore) salvaged the situation.  As for the rest of our stay, the breakfast spread is good, and offers a decent selection for everyone. What does bother me - and this is not particular to one hotel - is the limited selection for vegetarians. My wife and I are practicing vegetarians and therefore find it a little difficult to spot a buffet that has enough options for vegetarians. The Mandarin breakfast was nice, but not exceptional, as we hoped it would be.  Another thing, and this is pretty important to me, I wanted to point out is the mattresses. We woke up with a sore back every morning because the mattresses were just not right. We are not very picky about these things usually, but this time we had to highlight this. This is usually a sign of the property ageing and the management not giving it enough attention. I hope something is done about it.   Overall, a decent stay, and I may consider another stay if the rates are competitive. Let's see.â¦",8,May-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Just spent 3 days here, prior to F1 so a little busy.  Check in was quick and efficient.  Hotel lobby is very dark and dated and not a very welcoming entrance.  Almost identical to the Pan Pacific. Rooms were well fitted and pleasant, we were upgraded to a sea view, WOW what a view, the singapore flyer, gardens by the bay, marina Bay sands all in view, absolutely stunning. Pool was fantastic, personal service, small treats through out the day, iced water, frozen fruit, ice lolly handed out for, lovely touch.  Towels placed on sunbeds for you.  Lovely staff around the pool. Location for Marina Bay is fantastic, everything is nearby, one of the best locations in Singapore. Breakfast was one of the best Singapore offers, also with Al Fresco dining, great staff, attentive and pleasant.  Really felt special and treated with kindness.  Thank you Pauline (chef) for making my pancakes extra special. Highly rate this hotel, but the lobby is a let down being dark and un inviting. Always love the M.O. Hotels, having stayed in K. L. as well, just as good. We are certainly Fans of M.O. Well done to all staffâ¦",10,Oct-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Stayed here for the F1.  Check in smooth and detailed. Room clean and good size with an absolutely phenomenal view.  Bathroom - shower was very small and the water temp fluctuated slightly every 30-60 seconds. That is my only grope - we moved from here to Shangri-La and it was an inferior hotel in every way except one as the shower was much larger and consistent.   Pool area - amazing. Iced water, mango sorbet, cooling leg spray, sunscreen - all complimentary and service was top notch.   Breakfast - brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.   Expensive",10,Oct-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","I cannot wait to go back. Plain and simple. The hotel ticks every box and even more. Booking a club room was definitely cherry on top.   Our room had the most amazing view of Marina Bay! The room itself is spacious and the bathroom was huge.  The offering of breakfast, afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks at the club lounge was worth every penny! The staff were so gracious and helpful we couldn't help feeling sad by the time we left!",10,Sep-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Stayed for 5 nights with family. Plus points - 1. Location - Centrally located, we could walk up to the Marina Sands Bay, Gardens of the Bay, Singapore flyer or the Merlion. The Hotel is also connected to the 2 large Malls. Airport was about a 20 min drive. 2. Room - Fully carpeted with floor to ceiling window. We had booked a city view room. Would highly recommend booking Sea facing room. 3. Service - Great staff. We requested a stroller for our kid and the same got arranged. The hotel allowed delivery of food ordered online. 4. Breakfast spread was amazing. Overall an amazing stay. Will come back.",10,May-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","I was quite disappointed with our stay at the M.O. earlier this week. I checked out with relief that its over, just yesterday.   I booked an Ocean view Twin room for our family of four (two adults, two children). On checking in, we were directed to a King bedroom. I went downstairs to the lobby to ask them to correct this error. The receptionist issued a new keycard and we hauled our 5 suitcases and kids to the new room only to find that this was once again a King bed room. After that, I spent the whole day repeating my requests for a twin bed, which was acknowledged but ignored. We left the room twice for 2-4 hours to allow for the configuration change. Finally, at 8.55pm, the house manager called upon us and asked if everything was alright and that they were ready to change the beds to a twin configuration. It was of course far too late to change anything. My older one was asleep on the chair and younger one had already slept in the kingbed. Our sleeping arrangement was needlessly interrupted.   Other signs of poor service showed up when:   - the room was not cleaned at all on our second day. Used Towels were left the way it was in the bathtub, kingbed lay unamde. We called housekeeping to request for cleaning. Again, acknowledged but ignored.   - I voiced out my disappointment to the receptionist on their WhatsApp. They did not have the sincerity or courtesy to apologise for their negligence. They sent the housekeeping to address the twin bed configuration issue at night, at a late hour but by then honestly, I didn't want to deal with the change + my children being fast asleep.   Feeling ignored, and forgotten as a guest is perhaps the worst feeling while on holiday. I rather regretted choosing this hotel.   I would rate the service is there was one. There are many service providers ,but little service.   Two plus points about the hotel: The breakfast buffet and the location. But I could have done better research and picked literally any other hotel around the Marina area and had a better holiday experience that guarantees two basic requirements: sleep and responsiveness.   Mandarin Oriental Singapore is definitely a hard pass. We have absolutely no desire to return to this hotel. No longer a ""fan"" of M.O.â¦",8,Oct-22,

(I am in a city view suite and there are three different master switches that control three different but sometimes overlapping areas).   I upgraded from a lower floor ocean view room that is one of the standard rooms to a city suite. Let me make remarks on both:  The standard rooms are small.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","I am a fan, so I do stay a lot at the MOs, and also ranked top tier among the fans.   This hotel in Singapore is not up to it. Dated interior, understaffed, and service people seemed to be in training. Unruly kids were permitted to chase each other screeching and screaming in the echo chamber of the atrium. One could hear them 10 levels apart as if one be on a playground. None of the staff made an effort to tell the adoring parents that their kids' riot is not music to their peoples ears.

Mandarin have really stepped up their staff training because the folks here are amazing, every last one of them.   Beyond that the attention to detail is superb - a joggers refreshment station at the front of the hotel for the early risers and the pool attendant that knows my drink and room number after just one time of asking.   Outstanding isnât good enough to describe the service here.",10,May-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Everything is considered perfect (from check-in till I check-out) during the stay except that the bed is too soft. My mum and I have shared the same thoughts. Thus we didn't really sleep much the whole night. I must compliment the lady staff (didn't manage to get her name) who have assisted with the check-in who is so attentive and observant. She could sense that my elderly mum seem looking around for seats in the lobby while waiting for the check-in to be done. The staff asked me to bring my mum to area where there is sofa while she is processing the check-in. It is really such small gesture that makes the start of the whole staycation experience pleasant.

Every single staff we came across were simply excellent - from Princess Isabel who checked us in, to Immanuel at Dolce Vita, to the team members at the Poolside, at Melt Cafe for breakfast, the Housekeeping staff and members of the Front Office and Concierge teams, everyone was just superb - always a large smile on their faces.   The kids absolutely loved the personalised, hand drawn balloons that welcomed them as they entered the room. What a lovely, thoughtful gesture. I really loved how MO have gone every step of the way when talking about sustainability - from wooden toothbrushes with toothpastes in sachets to the recyclable glass bottles. A lot of organizations talk goodâ¦",10,Mar-22,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","I have stayed at MO thrice in the last 1 year. While the experience at MO has always been excellent, I am particularly impressed with the customer service level of Isabel at the check in counter. Isabel is not just professional and confident but is also very warm and helpful to her customers. While waiting for her hotel staff to confirm if the check in room is ready, she spent time chatting with us on our holiday activities and ensure our kid feels comfortable while waiting. Shes the best check in staff we have experienced in years, not just MO but also hotels elsewhere. Well done Isabel and MO management, please ensure you have a good staff retention programme.",10,Mar-22,

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Wherever we went in Singapore, including a weekend getaway to Sentosa, we felt like returning to the Mandarin Oriental was like coming back to our home away from home. We were always greeted warmly by name. Katya, in particular, could not do enough for us! She was somewhere between a mother hen and a sister, with her caring ways and always wanting to do more to make our stay in Singapore and in the hotel as positive an experience as possible. Less interface but just as positive was our eperience with Sabrina. They both seemed to get true pleasure out of assisting us in any way possible, especially as bumbling Westerners from the U.S. on our first visit to the super ""civilized"" Asian culture of Singapore.

We had a beautiful ocean view room with spectacular views - later we walked just across to esplanade and enjoyed the breeze and light shows  along Fullerton Bay Area. This hotel is also so so close to marina square, suntec and our favorite Millenia Walk where we satisfied our Japanese food cravings.   Spacious toilet with bath tub.

The hotelâs atmosphere was quiet and understated, and the guests appeared to be split more or less evenly between tourists and business customers. The main lobby/atrium is spectacular, with six lifts in a central column rising to the floors above. Every room is accessed via a balcony â while perfectly safe, as someone with a fear of heights I found it a bit difficult.  We took a marina bay view room, which had an incredible outlook across the marina to the skyscrapers beyond.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","We had the pleasure of holding our wedding at the Mandarin Oriental and Joanne, Jegan and the rest of the hotel staff delivered an outstanding level of service. They  switched us last minute to a suite where we (the bride and groom) could get ready separately without seeing each other before the wedding. They made our special day go smoothly by handling much of the details and coordination of our ceremony. Also Giruba and Mila at the Melt Cafe were fantastic hosts for our wedding dinner and made it an amazing experience! We highly recommend the Mandarin Oriental for a special event or even a staycation. The entire staff is super attentive and willing to accommodate special requests. You will not get better service at any other hotel in Singapore.",10,Mar-22,

However, we had to postpone our wedding twice due to covid-19,  and that's when Wendy took over and helped to facilitate the rest of the wedding planning. Wendy is personable and really easy to talk to and she has been an absolute gem on ensuring that we are on schedule throughout our entire wedding prep. She was also very accommodating even to our last minute changes. We could really tell that she did her best in making our wedding day as easy for us as possible and we really appreciate that!

I booked for the City suite and the room was really spacious. The swimming pool especially if at night, you are pampered with the beautiful view. We ordered chicken rice delivery, staff also speedily delivered to our room. The down part is the room pretty old designed,no bidet in toilets, small bath tub and no anti slip mats inside, the king bed is soft and sunk in hence we end up not sleeping well.

I was amazed that she remembered my name as I left, for she was serving so many other guests.  Top notched service, not pretentious at all. What the Japanese refer to as 'omotenashi'.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","After our Easter stay, we are back at MO for another stay on the eve of National Day. Due to the rescheduling of the National Day performance till 21 Aug, a ceremonial parade was held on the morning of National Day instead and as a result it became a bonus for us as we are able to sight the floating platform from our room. MO service continues to be top notch but the front desk staff appeared to be overwhelmed. While the bedroom is in need of some refurbishment, it was kept clean and comfortable. The button of the toilet bowl flush probably needs a fixing as it was tough to push down. It was another great stay at MO and I understand that MO will be supporting the stay home notice scheme and will be closed to the staycation guests the next day following our check out. Likely to be back soon following its opening.",10,9-Aug-21,

Seafood platter was fresh and the sauce was amazing, loving all the mains too and the Grand Cru Chocolate dessert! Though there was a little miscommunication on our change of the breakfast reservation the person I spoke to on the phone tried her best to expedite our breakfast for us. We feedback on the lift noise and there is a personal call after we check out from the manager to check on us if we are OK!

A definite must see.,10,Jun-22,

At the time, check in was busy and seemed it couldnât handle the capacity, despite arriving for our allocators time, we waited around 60-90mins to be checked in being passed from desk to desk which happens to be a walk between tower 1 and 3.  After getting checked in we got to our room and settled in. The rooms are amazing and the view incredible (city view) with great facilities and add ons with the complimentary mini bar, bottled water, snacks, etc. However we were put in a room next to a another under construction with continuous drilling/hammering starting at 9am and continuing way past 7pm.

The harbour view room I had was immaculate and the view outstanding. It overlooked the Bay of Gardens and was beautiful and colourful at night.

Marina Bay Sands,"As expected everything about marina bay sands is grand including its prices! Considering the high price you pay to stay there, customer service is patchy and inconsistent (from very good service most of the time to less than mediocre service some of the time). Security in accessing the Casino is more heightened (a little overkill) than immigration security at the airport! The infinity pool was nice and free ice cream was a plus (despite the pool being crowded due to school holidays). The free light show at the marina was spectacular (truly immersive and breathtaking). The floating apple store nearby was fun. If you can stay there without breaking the bank itâs worth it. The hotel room was nicely stocked and comfortable!",8,Jun-22,

At the front desk we missed our appointed check in time, but weâre ushered through to check in anyway at the front desk.  The lady there was very helpful and took us through all the perks/features of the hotel.  Make sure you sign up for the MBS rewards card before you go so you can get the points.  Make sure you scan it everytime you go shopping or dine in.  The rewards are well worth it.  At the Infinity Pool we had Moe play photographer (his one of the many lifesavers).

If you want to save money, go through Booking.com, but the rooms youâll get will be the lower floors and least desirable. If you book directly with the hotel, you may get the better rooms. I would double check both sites first to compare the rates before you book.  Now, letâs talk about the hotel. Itâs iconic and the most beautiful hotel in the city. The location is unbeatable. You can literally spend a week there if you could afford it. Thereâs three main towers connected by a long lobby on the bottom and the infinity pool on top.

It is a busy hotel and at times you will have to queue but this is expected when you staying at 2000+ room hotel! The staff did an amazing job to look after us and room and food choice was excellent.  We used Club 55 which is definitely worth the upgrade and never had any lunch as we were so full up with afternoon tea and evening drinks.

Marina Bay Sands,"This hotel is a must do in Singapore because of itâs amazing pool and the views. We had 2 rooms, one on 21st floor and one on 48th floor and both had the harbour view. I would totally recommend them over the city view rooms. Not only I think that the garden/harbour view is simply nicer but also because they have balconies which is amazing in the evenings as you can look at the many ships and the gardens by the bay. The lower floor room had a really big balcony and a super close view of the light and music show in the gardens. The upper floor room had a small balcony so could only stand there or alternatively sit in the room with the doors open. Both were great for different reasons.

Spago by Wolfgang Puck offers refinement, a rich menu with excellent choices and a wine list so impressive; that we struggled to choose.

This is the first hotel i have experienced where even kids had their individual key card.

If you go for first time to Singapore, definitely stay at the Marina Bay Sands, if you return, our next time, definitely stay at the hotels.",10,Jul-22,
Marina Bay Sands,Stayed in Marina Bay Sands Hotel from 2nd to 4th July 2022. I t was a great experience. The room is neat and  clean. The staffs are very helpful and  hertful. Especially ially when we went to Infinity pools at the top. It's a breath taking pictures and we met one of the staff called himself Moe. He is very cheerful and so much helpful. Giving us tips when and where to go and what to do in the hotel area. He also guide us to take a great pictures in The pool. Very amazing . ,10,Jul-22,
Marina Bay Sands,Me and my partner arrived at the marina bay sands and immediately you were helped out of the car and your luggage was taken from a lovely gentleman. We then went to check in and as we waited in the queue for too long (all of 5 mins) they fast tracked us to another counter and upgraded our room to a higher floor for the inconvenience. We didnât even complain but it was a lovely gesture. We then got to our room to find our luggage already there soon after a knock at the door with a lady wishing me happy birthday and handing over some cake which was a lovely touch! The pool was incredible and you get free snacks and drinks whilst you relax. We then went to watch the gardens by the bay light show from our room which we couldnât believe we could see it so clearly! Later in theâ¦,10,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"this place is Wonderful!  the view from the pool is fantastic!  all the staff are really nice and helpful, a special thanks goes to Moe, great man, always ready to help everyone.  Moe is the best!  TOP!  if you come to Singapore you can't miss it!  thanks again Moe!",10,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,We visited Singapore 10 years ago and promised our then 12 yr old daughter we would come back and stay at this iconic hotel.  So what could be more fitting than first trip out after Covid and our daughter graduating and about to start work.  It did not disappoint !! Arriving at 1.30am we were quickly checked in and upgraded to a magnificent room than was more than enough for the 3 of us overlooking garden by the bay. We loved having a balcony to have fresh air in the evening. On leaving our room to explore the amazing breakfast we were asked if our room could be cleaned ( at 9am !!!) and this continued throughout our stay . It was terrific to have the room sorted so early . All staff we encountered went out of their way to be approachable and helpful. The pool was just asâ¦,10,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Spent  the whole day at the beautiful pool yesterday. Was observing how this life guard, Ryan was assisting the hotel guests. He was simply amazing. Not only he went the extra miles for other hotel guests, he also rendered assistance to my family although his primary role is to ensure the safety of the guests using the pool.  He is definitely a valuable asset to MBS. Keep up the good work Ryan!. Thumbs up!",10,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Not in my wildest dreams, have I stayed in such a stunning hotel. We were given a complimentary upgrade to the most sumptuous suite I have ever been in. I felt like Lady Gaga. Two enormous bedrooms, massage room, gym, hair salon area, dining room, two fabulous bathrooms with jacuzzi baths - Hermes bath products and so it goes on. The beds were extremely comfortable and the view incomparable.  If I could 7 stars, I would! The staff were a delight, dinner in Lavo delicious.  We cannot thank you enough for such a memorable visit  Beyond every expectation.",10,Jul-22,
Marina Bay Sands,Treated like a queen and king from the moment we walked in.  The room over looked the gardens and was huge.  Please if you stay book into restaurants before you get there the first night we were there we couldnât get in anywhere and most restaurants were booked out for a few days.  However the room service menu was amazing had one of the best dinners in our room.  The shops of course are 5 star so make sure you have money.  In all it was a Great experience and would stay again,10,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is incredible! Itâs a real flaw that you can only access the pool from tower 3 and not the other 2 towers. Staff were excellent throughout except for at breakfast. Breakfast service in the Rise was extremely poor. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in large queues, even when there were empty tables that were simply not being cleaned. In a hotel that prides itself on efficiency, this was very poor. Even getting water at breakfast was bad as the lady âservingâ kept running out of glasses and took ages to get new ones. One elderly guest even resorted to bringing a bowl to get water as they needed some to take their medication! Overall the hotel and service was excellent but breakfast service was utterly terrible and needs to be sorted.",8,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We have always wanted to stay here after seeing the beautiful photos of the pool and building. The property is huge and on the pricey side. We upgraded to a harbor view room which had a lovely view. The room itself was nothing special and did show signs of wear, but was clean. They provided lots if bottled water in the room which was nice.  The pools view is as spectacular as you see in photos, BUT what they donât show you is how crowded it actually is with screaming splashing children alllllll over (not just in the childrenâs pool) . Because of this we stayed mostly in the small adults only area which was on one of the far corners of the pool.  The restaurants by the pool all require a dress code, men collar shirts and no sandals, pool wear not allowed which we found odd sinceâ¦",6,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,It was an experience of a lifetime. Especially with Life Guard Moe of the MBS Infinity Pool  making us feel so uniquely special n took gorgeous photographs of us at the pool. Moe you were great !   The observation deck was so beautiful so we are taking back wonderful memories of a beautiful time,10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"This hotel had been on out list of 'must do's' for a while, however it did not live up to all the hype. The check-in was slow and confusing. At the bar outlets (Ce La Vi & Lavo) the front of house staff were rude and unhelpful. The hotel rooms are big, but the quality is average, and the bathroom could be much better (e.g. rain shower & bath). The Infinity Pool is great, though obviously you have book a slot in advance. Overall a very average experience.",6,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"From the check in until check out the  service provided was exceptional. We arrived ahead of the scheduled check in time, and although our room was not ready completed the check in, left our luggage and headed out.  Within an hour we had not 1 but 2 calls to say that the room was ready and we could collect our room key. Once we collected our room key we headed to the lifts, and followed the bell hop into the lift with our luggage. Later that day we received a note apologising that the luggage was not in the room before we got there.  Wherever you went in the hotel help was on hand if you needed. I do understand that this is an expensive hotel, but we were impressed.",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed for our honeymoon and we had the best experience ever, this place is worth every penny! Special shootout-out to Moe in the Infinity pool! He made sure we had an experience of a lifetime, make sure you ask for him when youâre there!",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"A wonderful 2 day stay at the MBS. Time spent at the infinity pool with restrictions eased was the highlight. Moe, the lifeguard made the experience all the more memorable. He was a delight to talk to and his recommendation to watch the sunrise capped a memorable experience.",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"It was my first time in Marina Bay hotel but not my first time in Singapore.  I was in awe and I have been so delighted with how most of the staff took care of me from the moment I arrived. The lady who assisted me in frontdesk (RJ). She took care of everything, she even upgraded my room as i mentioned that it was my first time to stay in that hotel. Everything was perfect and seamless. RJ helped me booked for the swimming pool when she asked if I made a booking already, but i did not. She explained everything that I need even for the pre departure pcr test that we need for my flight. She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The restaurants are awesome, and the hotel is very convenient to go for shopping since everything is just a few minutes walk away from the hotel. I wishâ¦",10,Mar-22,

Marina Bay Sands,"I booked a room with my friends at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Before check in, we browsing around the nearby gift shop. Although there were no guests, the staff at the door still received us warmly, which made us a good first impression of the girl and the store. The staff was very measured and just came to help us when we needed. We don't like the staff who always follow you to introduce goods. Due to we were in a hurry to check in, we planned to come back later to buy something. Finally, we asked her name ""Jenny"", hoping to meet this girl againï½",10,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Check out the enchanting skyline at night with free music and lights show from Marina Bay Sands. Marina Bay Sands itself is a great destination for shoppers and diners, with its wide variety of eateries and shops, from high end to mass market. Not to forget, there's the casino and lovely hotel rooms with great views of Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay park",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,Pool rules of 1hr per person per day had just gone. Yet we still had to check in. It was a bit of a mess. We would all line up in the heat and some people couldnât get the thing to work. Not the best when youve been dying to visit the most iconic pool in the world. We couldnât get a drink and swim because there are only certain times for that. So had to plan accordingly. Whatever happened to pool side service? I literally only stayed for the pool. The casino was a nightmare. No drinks in sight. Thatâs changed. You canât even get a water. One night I went downstairs at 10pm to visit 7/11 and was stopped by security. âCLOSEDâ but was told by staff itâs open. Hotel check in took forever be aware of this as it eats into pool and dinner time. Checkout is a breeze with the card drop.â¦,6,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Our family has a great staycation experience at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The service was excellent. For housekeeping we are giving the scheduled time  when they can makeup the room even it is already late in the afternoon.  For the infinity pool, the staffs assigned there are very polite and kind. Special mention to Mr. Dennis who made our stay more enjoyable. He made sure that we have all what we need from the towels, water and even the free ice cream that was served. We were all satisfied even there's a limited time for swimming. Thank you MBS and to your friendly and courteous staffs like Mr. Dennis. We will back for sure! More power.",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for three nights in May of 2022. Would I recommend this resort to a friend? Yes. Would I stay their again knowing what I know now about the resort? Yes.  We had a Deluxe King Sky View. It had great views of the city and skyline. The only reason we stayed at the hot was for access to the roof top infinity pool. It it wasnât for the pool I would not stay at the hotel. It doesnât feel like you are staying in a hotel. It feels like you are staying in a mall. The hotel is big and impersonal.   The pool is great. Amazing views of the city. However, my wife and I were wanting to have a drink in the pool and watch the sun set. Sounds great doesnât it. But the pool area does not have an adult only section or pool. This means that thereâ¦",8,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Thereâs nothing bad to say anything about this hotel! Our experience there was awesome. Room was big n clean, comfy pillow. Service from the hotel staffs was awesome especially from Infinity Pool Mr Moe & team. Location is perfect too!  The staff, Moe is very thoughtful and observant. He shared pics on his mobile on which best time and location to take on sunrise, sunset & A Light & Water show at night. He has helped us to take on our family photo. We felt so touched by his warm gesture. The staff give us complimentary beverages during swimming session in the evening on last Friday, May 6 with this pleasant thought. We will come back again.",10,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Stay: 4th May to 5th May 2022  Booking: Self  Review:  Value for Money: Booked the Deluxe Room (Garden View) directly through mail interaction with their reservation desk @ Sing Dollar (SGD) 1,046.35/- per night which is a luxury but totally worth it. We got bumped up the Deluxe Room King size (Garden view) Tower 2 which sweetened the deal. The room is on the 47th floor and had the Gardens view  Service Quality: Awesome. Hotel staff is accommodating in every sense of the word. Smooth check-in and very comfortable  Food & Drink: The hotel has lots of choices to choose from and the same can be browsed from the in-room TV menu. There is a rooftop restaurant Spago where one can enjoy their evening swims with food and drink. You may choose to have your meals at the bay area â¦",10,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We booked a Deluxe King Sky View Room on the 44th floor. It was a very spacious room with an amazing view. The team was nice enough to provide us with an early check-in. The service was pretty quick as our luggage had reached the room before us and the extra bed was placed within 5 minutes of that.   The pool is obviously amazing at any point of time and they have amazing hot tubs as well. The drinks in the pool are not that costly. Sling or pina colada costs SGD 25-26 (inclusive of taxes).   I would suggest anyone who is visiting Singapore to stay on this hotel for at least one night and enjoy the property, be it the room, pool, casino or mall.",10,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed a night only at the Marina Bay Sands, and met Moe at the infinity pool.

Marina Bay Sands,"Staying here for 2 weeks. Maybe due to tower 2 closed for renovations, the hotel is near full occupancy. Couldnât book a suite and settled for a room with âgardenâ view. The garden is the supertree grove so pretty cool. Got a low 12th floor so pretty disappinted  The porter is helpful, the front desk pretty grumpy. The rest of the staff from housekeeping to operators to gym/pool staff are thankfully as pleasant as the porter  The room is ok sized with a generous balcony and 50-60 inch flat screen tv. The bed is disapponting - not king sized nor luxurious. Towels too, are worn and cheap feeling. So no 5 star luxury feels here  Because the hotel is huge with 3 towers, it is extra exercise walking to the gym and pool. The gym is large and ok. The world famous pool is always crowdedâ¦",8,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,Great trip to Singapore as part of a leg to Maldives from UK. The hotel was our first choice and although more expensive than some other local luxury options it was worth it overall.   Rooftop infinity pool sets this place apart not the service or rooms or food.,8,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed a night in a garden view deluxe room and found it amazing. This is not a hotel, it is a resort with more than 2500 rooms. Still, check in was rather effektive. (They use a lot of time everywhere in Singapore). Rooms were great with good amenties and great views of the gardens and the supertree grove. We spent an intire day first row in the world renowned infinity pool. To be honest - this is why we booked a room here. One thing we did not understand is why the signage told that children had to be above 13 yrs to enter, but a lot of 7-8-9 yr old still splashed around, ruining the experience for other guests. Why??? Still - it was an amazing experience and is highly recommended :)",10,Jun-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed 5 nights in a harbour view room on level 42.  Checkin was quick and we were made to feel welcome.  Room was spacious and the views spectacular. Bed and pillows are a little on the hard side.  Obviously we stayed here to experience the infinity pool and it didnât disappoint. Pool and bar staff are amazing. Special shout out to Maurice, Mary & Ryan.  Location is also close to so many attractions and food options.  Only small criticism we have is the breakfast in Spago. The manger should take a trip to W @ Sentosa to see how a breakfast should be done.  Having said that it didnât affect our stay and we loved every minute of our time here and will be back for sure. Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable and it made for one of theâ¦",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"One of the reasons we did a stop over in Singapore was to stay at this hotel. Yes, its almost $500 a night. They were very outgoing- allowed us to check in early at 930am- which is virtually unheard of anywhere. They also upgraded us to a king bed high floor with views of the gardens. Staff are outstanding. Facility is beautiful- beyond words. Infinity pool awesome- no longer any limits on time you can spend at the pool. Food super pricey as expected. 3 mini sliders and 2 drinks at the pool for $70 USD. Highly recommend 1 night stay for the experience. Free water and soft drinks in the room fridge is a nice touch.",10,May-22,

On 25 May 2022 at about 7.15pm, I and one of my food buddies were warmly welcome by Marcus Choong,Â  the AGM of Blue Pearl Restaurant and he then led us to our dinning table which is at a secluded corner of the said restaurant. This is our 4th or 5th visit to Blue Pearl, and we cannot stop returning because of the delicacies created by the Chief Chef, Jason Lau have always been scrumptious and delectable.

Marina Bay Sands,Had a brilliant time from start to finish. Room was stunning - 53rd floor overlooking the gardens was really worth it. Staff were super helpful and friendly. Pool was as amazing as all the pictures. So many hotels in Singapore but definitely recommend this one!

Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed in many 5 Star Hotels in Singapore over the years. The MBS has clearly a great view! Impressive!  Yet, the lobby is like a train station, busy noisy, friendly yet very nusy staff. Breakfast isn't recommended, but Chinese lunch was ok to good.  The pool and view terrace on top of the iconic building is a bit over regulated. Certain areas couldn't be accessed for picturing (alneit bekng empty) and it was entirely clear why the staff follows such procedures.  Rooms are good but a bit dated. Gym is great, good views, and friendly staff.  I wouldn't want to stay there and rather pick other places.",6,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Awesome hotel with the best views, location and service. It was amazing to watch the spectra light and water show from our room. We were on the 45th floor and the room was large with comfortable beds. The pool which is exclusive to hotel guests only is spectacular! Shopping galore and worth every penny. Definitely the best hotel in Singapore!",10,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"This is purely about their room service.   It took 5 mins for them to respond and they informed us that they had wait times of over an hour. This is ridiculous for a 5 star hotel that I am paying nearly SGD2000. Unheard of anywhere else in the world, but in Singapore, all they say is suck it.   I am still here.",2,May-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We had stayed there specifically for the reason to access their trademark Infinity pool with a view of singapore skyline. And we were not disappointed. We were able to access the pool as many times as we want. The pool is opened from 6 Am to 11 Pm. The water is good, the service is perfect, they have people serving refreshments along the pool sides at no extra cost.  The rooms are luxurious with perfect services for in room dining as well. Particularly Mr. Sean had taken care that my 3 year old baby is also served well. Brought some in house chocolates for her along with my beer tasting bucket. They extended our check out till 2 PM.

Everything we did as a family was hard, had to make reservations to empty restaurants, hours were bizarre and just seemed like a communist strict dull city. All the gear no idea.",2,Aug-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed at MBS for the first time and was disappointed at the long checkin lines, crowded infinity pool, and overall retail atmosphere of the hotel. All restaurants were overbooked and reservations had to be made months in advance. After spending more than $1000 on integrated resort purchases we were told that our loyalty points would expire in 12 months with no option to redeem destination dollars online. Our Prestige status would also be downgraded if we did not continue to spend. This is not how you treat loyal customers! As a tourist, this discourages me from returning to MBS. Very commercialized hotel with poor concern for customers. We also stayed at the Shangri-La during our trip for less than half the price of MBS and the atmosphere was much more refined.",2,Aug-22,

Marina Bay Sands,"Obviously a very luxurious stay but feels more like a business resort than a hotel. We were a honeymoon couple but they werenât bothered by that. We choose this hotel thinking it would be the best in Singapore but were left feeling a bit deflated. A lot more work is needed in making guests feel like they are in-fact staying in the best hotel in Singapore.

It was not crowded at all and enjoyed the pool as well as the hot tubs overlooking the ships.

I suggested to the hotel that guests paying nearly $900 a night - should be advised to book the restaurants in advance of their stay so they are not disappointed.

Staff arenât the friendliest.   Also would like to add the hotel is super crowded partly due to connecting with the mall I suppose.   My overall experience wasnât really great and thatâs my personal experience but i am pretty sure for some guests it was memorable one.",4,Sep-22,

At 6:50 my companion would leave the pool and head down to the Cafe ORIGIN + BLOOM. The coffee is great. But without fail, my companion, Maria, would return with our coffee saying how nice Linda at the front counter was to her. This happened every morning. Linda remembered our orders and always had a warm smile. So yeah, the hotel is amazing but always remember, its the people working there that makes it so. ",10,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"4 hours for hotel to arrange a room despite check-in @3.45pm, followed by 2 different versions of why the lengthy wait occured.   Worst is the service recovery that we didnt request for by a person called Jeevan. We dont usually go to such lengths to post. But his story of an IT outage causing Phone service to jam was absurd.",2,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Way overpriced for what you get.  Donât get me wrong the view of the pool was amazing but without that the hotel is nothing.  Was Â£1000 for one night, and not worth it. I had dirty bedding which had to be changed. We couldnât get into any of the roof top bars which I think as we were a hotel guest for one night we should have been Abel to. That was very disappointing.  The room wasnât wow, which for that amount of money was also very disappointing. We spent most of our time at the infinity sky pool which was amazing but the only amazing thing of our stay. Had this been half the price perhaps I would have been more wowed but itâs defo not worth the money of the stay!  I had paid half the price of this for hotels which have been outstanding.",6,Sep-22,

Marina Bay Sands,"I enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands, our room was a Garden View which was excellent. We could watch the Supertree show from our balcony which was a really cool experience because you could see the whole thing, as opposed to when you're actually at the Supertree show you only get a partial view. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, Nicholas who checked us in was excellent, he was so helpful and made sure we knew everything about the hotel that we needed to. Candy in the gift shop was also wonderful, so friendly and helpful. The pool is an awesome experience, as it wasn't peak season we got to go a few times.

The beginning was fabulous as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and also had an upgrade to the MBS ""Prestige"" Rewards Program, so we were upgraded to a fabulous suite, with a view of both the bay and gardens. They also delivered a cute little cake. We had signed up for the Re-Imagine promo and received a free voucher for each night of stay for either breakfast, lunch, rooftop lounge, science museum, or infinity pool photos. The Rise Restaurant was excellent with an amazing array of choices.   MBS is an incredible structure, with the best location. We walked to the Gardens by the Bay twice. Of course, the infinity pool and Observation deck are a must do as well.   The MBS Rewards program gives cashâ¦",10,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,I was on a trip to Bali and decided to stop over at Singapore for two nights which I booked via their website. I booked a superior room which was on the highest level as I wished to experience the beautiful views across the city and Of course the infinity pool. However when I arrived after my long flight I started to encounter issues. I was only allowed to book one night as there was an issue with my card. So I stayed the one night. I was told to check and book again in the morning for the second night. Which I did but my card got declined. So I then had to leave the hotel to stay at the airport. I then find out a few days later that my card has been charged for the second night. This hotel would not allow me to stay the second night and happily escorted me out but then charge aâ¦,2,Sep-22,

All rooms with Bay view have no opening windows nor the balconies, however the Garden View rooms are having this, advantage. You can slide yoyr glass open and, enjoy the view from your balcony including evening concerts  in the gardens with illumination of the artificial forest. All services were perfect.

The room was dirty, with large staining on the bed, which we had to ask to be changed - no dressing gowns or slippers.  We had young adults with us - who asked at the pool area, about the music venue, on this floor (of which we could have booked, but was told the night club might suit them better), so didnt book, when they went to the nightclub, it was shut - they went back to floor 57 (i think it was 57), to be told oh sorry - yes i gave you thee wrong info - but then wouldn't let them as it was full, and they didnt book - although advised not to.

Marina Bay Sands,Itâs a Disney World.  You have to wait for everything. You have to pre-register what time you want to check in. You get a ticket and wait for your number to be called just to check in. The pool is cool. But you get only 1.5h a day and you have to register what time you want to access 24h prior. And itâs nothing relaxing. Full of Instagrammers taking photos and the staffs are constantly asking your room numbers to ensure 1.5h limit.  The rooms are okay. Service is okay but nothing personal. Never again.,4,Aug-22,

Marina Bay Sands,"This could be a long overdue review since we stayed at Marina Bay Sands Singapore last 31st of July which was our most awaited honeymoon destination. We booked for 3 nights stay to a premium room. Everything was planned perfectly until we arrived in the hotel. There was a flocked of people everywhere, we donât have any idea what was going on upon entering the door. We approached a gentleman wearing a black suit that we wanted to checked in and we found out that we could not check in because the hotel was having a system down. My husband and I wanted to melt down coming from a long flight only to found out that we could not get our room upon arriving the hotel. It was around half past 3 o clock when we arrived.

Marina Bay Sands,"I visited Marina Bay for 2 nights on our way to Bali. Lots to share to help everyone make their decision if this is the place to stay in Singapore (we believe it is.)  Food - visited Spago and Cest la vie bar. Be clear when you book Spago if you want the fine dining as we made this mistake and we couldnât then get a reservation at the fine dining as it was fully booked and they have a strict dress code so my boyfriend in shorts and a shirt wouldnât have been allowed in anyway. The food was okay but we didnât get to experience the fine dining which Iâm sure would be out of this world.  Pool - way more impressive by night than by day.

The continental buffet breakfast offers a wide selection of different cuisines with local tropical fruits and juices.",10,Aug-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Great hotel and great experience.  The staff are very friendly, the hotel and rooms are extremely clean and the views are panoramic.  Overall, Marina Bay Sands is worth the price of staying there at least once.  The infinity pool is almost always open (6am-11pm) and was not crowded at all.  During our stay there, we went to the pool as many times as we could and easily found lounge chairs.  My only complaint is that the pool is not heated so it can get cold especially in the mornings.  The food at the restaurants and the food court was delicious.  The hotel is walking distance from one of the hawker centers (Lau Pa Sat) passing the marina into downtown.  The metro station and bus stops are right there so taking public transportation was not a problem.  We did our own city tourâ¦",10,Aug-22,

Despite the jaw dropping skyline views and the delicious food an drink options, one thing that made this trip memorable was a life guard named Moe.

Marina Bay Sands,"Iâm staying at the hotel at the moment and I wanted to give my initial impressions.  The check-in process as well as booking to use the infinity pool are a bit quirky. Both require registration within 24 hours of arrival but the system was down when I tried and the backup mobile number also did not work. Slightly unusually, the reservations team does not seem to be as accessible as in other hotels (a bit slow). Prior to arrival, you are certainly left feeling that you have booked at a five-star hotel, but you are not being treated as an essential customer.  Upon arrival, we had a short wait during our registered check-in period but once all the paperwork had been completed (took longer than checking in at other hotels) we were left to our room and started enjoying the premises. â¦",6,Aug-22,

We didnât use a huge amount of the hotel amenities but the infinity pool is spectacular and well worth staying at the hotel for.  Transfer from Changi is quick by taxi and pretty reasonably priced and would recommend as a low stress option.   The hotel isnât cheap by any means but itâs quite an experience, certainly one we wonât forget.",10,Jul-22,

We waited about 30 minutes for our check in opportunity.  We used the infinity pool deck and enjoyed our time there watching the sunset, and had some drinks and appetizers.

Tonnes of overpriced designer stores, and a relatively close food court and other good eating options nearby, seemingly for the Mainland Chinese visitors, good access for MRT and Taxis are almost non stop.   The rooms were large and very comfortable, we all loved the automatic curtains and the large bathrooms.  The Gardens by the bay are a great experience with the shuttle if the idea of a walk in 28c doesn't appeal to you.

Marina Bay Sands,Service for check-in was quick. You will need to register before checking in so that you won't have to wait long. Sms will be sent informing you of your Queue number.   We stayed at L51 at Tower 3 with City View. The room is huge with two big tv screens. The view is awesome. In the front is the city view that overlooks the water and on the left is the Garden by the bay view. The infinity pool has great views too. A little crowded but we managed to take some great photos. They were short staff but service is still top notch. The night view is best with lights up from Garden of the Bay as well as the city view. There is no time limit to using the pool.,8,Aug-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"It seems to be a must do while in the city.  Once you get to the top there are great views but like everything else in Singapore (apart from the trains) it is expensive to eat/drink there. As a visitor you need to pay to get to the top platform but are restricted in the areas you can go to unless you are a resident - as in you cannot go to the infinity pool.  Cost per person is $22SGD/Â£13/16USD as of February 2020. The views of the city and shoreline are great, it overlooks the F1 circuit and I would consider it a must do on a visit.  If you can afford to stay there you will get much more however as a tourist it should be on your Singapore bucket list.  It is also great to wander around the ground and mall on ground level.",8,Sep-21,

However, the reception staff Alice was genuinely concerned about us as we just arrived following a long flight and she noted it was my birthday, she ensured escalating the matter to her manager Lydia who took care of us very well.

Marina Bay Sands,"The infinity pool is awesome. I recommend the first time to visit the pool at dark, it is just amazing. At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition. The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.",8,May-22,

I recommend that you book your restaurants well in advance of your vacation. Sadly most of the restaurants at the hotel were fully booked for the duration of our stay, which didnât leave many options for us. Room service took a very long time, which is understandable given the size of the hotel.  We appreciated the chocolates offered to us by the hotel, as a gift for our honeymoon.

This is really helpful and efficient as we can select the slot at which you want to check in and need not unnecessarily wait in the Q.  You get an SMS when your turn is up.  Room : Room is well equipped and large.  I has all the amenities and few bottles of soft drinks and few packs of snack are complementary during your stay.  Bathroom is spacious with a bath tub and separate shower and toilet . â¦,10,Nov-21,
Marina Bay Sands,"Special event weekend, I chose the Marina Bay Sands.  Why?  I wanted to experience the infinity pool, enjoy a relaxing break, and enjoy a premium hotel looking across the little Red Dot.  I wish I had booked elsewhere.  Here is where it went so wrong.    A) Check In.  We arrived at our designated check in time, albeit 7 minutes late.  Our check in time had passed, so we had to wait for the check in system to be available again with our number.  That took time to reboot/rework. Meanwhile, the check in staff were waiting for us behind the bunker with no one to serve.  Farcical.  B) Room.  Went to our room.  Amazing view across to the city. But there was something wrong.  That's right.  There was one lounge chair.  I looked at my husband, and I thought, there's furniture missingâ¦",4,Nov-21,

Her service was excellent! As she processed our booking, she noticed the date and it was my partnerâs birthday which I didnât mention upon reservation. Alice wished him Happy Birthday and upgraded us from Premier Garden view to Premier Harbour view and explained itâs on the higher floor.

To begin with, staff of Premium Services, Ms Joanne Gonzaga and Mr Jerry Wong.  The view from our room is AWESOME.  Thank you for ensuring that we were well taken care of, simple things like valet, refreshments, thoughtful treats for the wife and kids and dining-in options (because it was so nice, we did not feel the need to leave the hotel).

He helped visitors to take beautiful photos for them to keep as memories, inform you when will be the best time to take photos at the Skypark etcâ¦  Despite we have met him only for once, we find him a person who is so passionate about his work, heâs more of a tour guide Cum lifeguard, not many are like him.

I approached a service staff at the reception area and she mentioned that I will have to come back again in 2 hours to check in, advised me to put my luggage at the holding area and ""have some coffee"" for 2 hours. This is a disappointing way of handling a customer request. We were late due to the horrendous parking situation and now further punished by having to wait for 2 hours for a room that is already ready? She did not bother to make any effort to give us a good holiday experience.

Making up for the lack of historical legacy and geographical location, MBS boasts of grandiose in its unique architectural style and all-hands-on-deck service that is uniquely Singapore.  Few hotels in the can match the breathtaking panorama from the 2000+ guest rooms. My advice is to opt for one with a city view.   Rooms are impeccably appointed and cleaned.  Mine ($500 per night) is humongous with two very huge independently controlled LCD TV.   Techies will like that the hotel system is linked to restaurants and brand-name shops across the MBS campus.

Room and bathroom was capacious as there was still space for a small dining area even with the additional bed (which was set next to the balcony).

Marina Bay Sands,"What is the hype besides the view and the infinity pool.  This is my take on MBS, as I come from a 5 star hotel too. A 5 star hotel should upkeep its standards of luxury and flawless guest services.  Check in was a breeze, aside from the long usual queue and waiting time, I got my keys within 30 mins.  (Cons of checking in during school holidays).  I am travelling with an infant, hence upon making my booking, I informed that I would require a baby cot.  Upon check in, I called the operator and was told that the baby cots were out of stock.

I have to say that my experience would not have been so great if I hadnât met the very kind-hearted and sweet lifeguard at the infinity pool. Thank you, Mr. Moe Lamit! On that Saturday evening, I was alone near the pool (no one went to the pool alone) and randomly asked Moe if there is any swimming ring I could rent (since I couldnât swim). I didnât know that I caught an angel by then.

No other spaces are available, good luck if you are trying to multitask and rush out some last minute work because there is NO SINGLE AVAILABLE SPACE. You have to snatch one of the 18 seats if possible, from one of the hundreds of people standing around in the lobby.  The weird acyclic light installation is super precious - you cannot rest your laptop on it, but children can crawl all over it. I didnât know laptops are heavier than children.  If you have no adequate seating, ensure your checkin process is staggered out and quick. I see at least 4-5 groups in each queue, and even the vip queue has 4-5 people. â¦",2,Sep-21,

Housekeeping was prompt in doing their cleaning services, but the room service took some time for any request to be sent over. We understood it could be a peak period during that time. The TV  network was intermittent, as it kept on hanging. We would like to suggest the hotel to have some Malayscian good channels.  Toilet does not have a toilet spray bidet.

The orchid suite at MBS, way up on 53rd floor tower 3, in my opinion is a much better experience than suites I have reviewed on TripAdvisor at St. Regis, Sofitel, Fairmont, or Andaz. Absolutely go for this suite if given the option.  Since we spent a week, we saw stunning, dramatic weather, rapidly changing, and really beautiful sunrises and vistas across the strait and Singapore.

Marina Bay Sands,"We enjoyed lunch on the top floor resto. It was just a great experience. The staff is super friendly and supportive. The view is breathtaking. Definitly worth a visit. Just book it ahead of time. Around the Hotel are many things to visit like the gardens by the bay with indoor waterfalls, giant trees or ponds to stroll around.",10,Oct-20,
Marina Bay Sands,It is a great hotel and we enjoyed the stay.   We arrived at around two PM but the check in is very slow and the check in hall with packed with people and was hot. It took like half an hour to finish the process and took another ten minutes at the MBS Rewards counter to get breakfast voucher. Very inefficient and we nearly missed the swimming session booked.  However the rest of the stay was getting better. I booked two rooms and one city view room got upgraded to sky view room and the rooms were spacious. The room I stayed got two giant TVs at least 80 inches each. It has a big sofa area and the sofa is in fact a sofabed as well.  The view from the room was spectacular. You got the best bay view in Singapore from the room. The room was expensive if you just looked at the datedâ¦,10,Sep-21,
Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands more than halve a dozen occasions but have never considered the rooms to be anything to shout about. The only one big reason you want to stay in the MBS is the following. The Garden Seaview or the Marina Bay Seaview. Other than that the rooms depending on the tower you are in are just normal, interior nothing to go GOOGOO about. The other only reason is the ICONI reason to take a pic at the infinity pool and dine at Spagos....ooops and not forgetting if you love gamblings and dorning the MBS Bath Robe and walking all over the shopping mall. With that being said, the few restaurants that are found around the MBS including their very own hotel coffee shop serves some pretty delicious food.",8,Dec-20,

Marina Bay Sands,"Finally, we did a staycation at MBS hotel! This is definitely one of the hotel on my âmustâ stay list.  Was appalled by the crowds of people waiting to check in, this certainly dont seem like a pandemic is going on right now!   Thankfully, we booked the grand club room which offers personalised check-in in our room.  The enhanced check-in services provided by the premium team was amazing. All we have to do, is to give them a call prior to our arrival on the day itself, and there will be someone assigned to standby for our arrival at the valet area.  We were immediately greeted by Allie, the moment we stepped out of the car. Simply awesome! Needless to say, we were directed straight to our room for check-in.  We were given a room upgrade to their Orchid suite on the 52th floor.â¦",10,Sep-21,
Marina Bay Sands,Stayed 2 nights at MBS and truly a great experience. The service given was indeed what MBS is known for really excellent service from the staff. From communication through email before checking in as I was having my solemnization held there. All the way throughout the whole stay and even till checking out of the hotel just such a great experience. Upon check in day timing for check in was followed closely hence did not have to wait long at all to get checked in to the hotel as I had to be in the room at a certain timing as I had a make up artist coming and the staff got the room ready earlier for me. Not to forget throughout the whole stay in MBS there was definitely a lot of service touch done by them and it is something I have never experience as much from other hotels that Iâ¦,10,Sep-21,

The boat shaped hotel suspended above 3 towers allows the rooms to have a unblocked view of the oceans or the city.  Checking in was super efficient, rooms were clean and well stock.   Have the Marina Bay Sands Casino at the lobby level as well as a 3 storey shopping mall as annexe.   Food variety and restaurants are aplenty. On top of this we have the Garden by the Bay at the door step.",10,Jul-21,

We took full advantage of the drinks and Canapes package, I do think the restaurant need a lot more people serving though, only 2 people at the time. The pool area as expected was really nice I was not impressed with the check-in system, you're asked what time we want to arrive, we arrived, only for the lady to tell us we would have to wait 10 min ok no problem, then another gentleman said it would be 20-40min wait!!! Â Thankfully it was more like a 7min wait. We really did enjoy our staycation, its just a shame it was cut short by the new regulations.Â I do think it spoils the ambiance having so many Social Distancing policeâ¦",10,Jul-21,

Marina Bay Sands,"The stay itself was very pleasant and amazing, not to mention the fantastic hospitality and brightness of the staff. Especially a lifeguard by the infinity pool, Moe. He's extremely friendly and is more than willing to snap pictures for you. Not to mention, the shots he takes look as if a professional photographer had taken it. He also knows every good spot to take those pictures at, so don't worry about ideas of places to take photos! Moe was also very helpful and happy to assist all the time with a huge smile plastered on his face. You can easily strike up a conversation with him and he would be more than glad to share more about Marina Bay Sands. Overall, this hotel stay was excellent and I would 100% come again",10,Apr-22,
Marina Bay Sands,I stayed at marina bay sands for 2 nights. This is a large hotel and there are things to take note of.   1. Booking or pool  You can book for a slot at the infinity pool 1 day prior to check in. For our stay. We have 3  slots. 1 slot per day. Each 1 hour 15 mins.  You can book all slots at the same time.  I would advise you to book earlier as many slots are not available when I tried to book.   2. Check in  The check in time is at 3pm. I reached the hotel at 2:45 and have a hard time self parking. In the end I valet park instead. The hotel car parking is surprisingly full with many cars waiting for an empty lot.   In the end I was at the check in counter at 3:10. I have to wait for about 15 mins before I check in.  A bit of waiting.   3. Room  The room is decent. The tv is largeâ¦,8,Dec-21,

Then we have this thought to have staycation at MBS for at least once a year. Last year, we have our ROM and Honeymoon staycation at MBS in Aug 2020 and Oct 2020. I can say that was the most memorable stay at MBS. The staff that attended to us auto-upgraded our room to club room for FOC and give us a late check-out. All the staff we met was friendly greeting us(except for the staff at club 55 that served those guest that booked the club room as we are not aware only those guest that ""booked"" the club room is allow to enter the facility and we are given ""FOC"" for the club room so we are not allow to enter, the staffâ¦",4,Dec-21,

We stayed at the 45th floor of the property and we had access to their super amazing infinity swimming pool. The hotel, itâs services, staff are all top class and very polite and ever ready for all kind of assistance.

Marina Bay Sands,"2nd time staying here (last time being 5+ years ago) and still amazing even during a pandemic.   - Check-in process is cleverly covid-safe designed to stagger people so no crowding in the lobby. You book a time slot and can track when it's your turn to approach a counter online.   - Sky Infinity Pool access is no longer unlimited time, COVID era unfortunately however it is super safe with guests needing to book a time slot in advance. each time slot session ends they clean the area for the next lot of guests. Capped guest limit is a blessing in disguise, so much easier to take photos and have a swim now!   - Super attentive service by all staff we encountered or walked past in the hallways.

Pros: - Great views from room, and a good size too. - Excellent and warm service by all, from concierge to housekeeping.  A shoutout to the pool staff who were friendly and helped make each swim enjoyable, no matter what time of day. - Bathtub in room, and some complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the minibar. - Infinity pool was wonderful. We were there three times, at sunrise, evening and late evening.  Loved the jacuzzi too.  Good that only hotel guests can use this as it cuts down on numbers in the pool.

The suite was truly incredible and the service we received was very professional. We didnât have to queue for the lifts as others have mentioned. We managed to book 1hr 15 minutes each day of our stay at the pool. There was plenty of slots available which meant we could go in the morning and the evening for photos.

Marina Bay Sands,"This is an amazing place, the location is incredible and the facility has great amenities.  However this is where it begins and ends.  Breakfast- wait in a line for up to 10 mins to be seated each morning. Wait in another line for up to 10 mins at most food station. A very uneasy and stressful way to begin your day on a vacation.   Staff- perhaps due to covid, bad management or lack of care the staff are generally quite rude.  Particularly the staff at the pool area. Itâs closer to an asylum rather than a pool. From being greeted with âare you going to your roomâ rather than a hello or good morning. Good luck using your own infinity pool also, youâll need to book each day of your generous 45 mins of pool time at least 1 week In advance.  I will say this is not to the valetâ¦",4,Mar-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"The hotel is lovely - we've had fantastic meals in a couple of the restaurants (Spago, Lavo), have been to the infinity pool and had breakfast at Rise. The staff overall have been lovely and super helpful. As with anything, you need to pick your time well if you want to avoid the queues. Just in from Australia, we were in Rise for breakfast at 7am - no queues. We also visited the infinity pool at 9am rather than one of the busier parts of the day. Yes it can be busy but you can plan around it. The downside that you can't plan around, is the behaviour of other guests. On a Saturday night, the hotel is 'party central' with people coming back from other venues and 'kicking on' in their rooms. The music has thumped incessantly from about 3am to 6.15 so far and no signs of it slowingâ¦",6,Mar-22,

Booking for the infinity pool located on level 57 is simple, either via SMS or by scanning the QR code on the check in brochure.  Same goes for the Banyan GYM on level 55 in Tower 2.

Checkin process is a efficient as they had virtual queue in which you put down your name and number then it will notify you once you're ready to be served (so you are able to browse around or sit down somewhere nearby without standing in line). We didn't have a SG number so we were standing infant of the numbering machine waiting.

Alan made sure to keep the large bouquet of roses I bought were safe. He even went the extra step to find a place where it could be stored in the fridge for me.

Being an avid cyclist, the fact that I could store my bicycle was a definite plus!  What struck me the most as I entered the room was the enormity of it. The hotel did not stinge on space for their rooms. My room was well maintained, with guest amenities aplenty.

In this hotel you find everything you need, many great options for dining and drinking. My favorite is the Sunday brunch at Lavo. Wow it is good!  The staff is talanted and very well trained. The quality of service was excellent. Special thanks to Mustika in the reception lounge who made my stay more than wonderful!  Marina Bay surprised me in very good way, You will find more than just spectacular views. It is really a destination on its own with restaurants, shopping and also within walking distance to all attractions in the city.  I highlyâ¦",10,Jan-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"My friend and I had booked a stay at MBS during November (Covid SSM still in place). Shirley checked us in on the desk and organised a special room for us. We were taken to our room - the veiw across the city was brilliant. The room was tidy and clean. The bathroom and bath tub were excellent. We booked a pool slot for the day time and lifeguard Moe was very friendly and helpful. We were able to book an evening slot for the pool too (really recommend doing this if you can) and Leo was the pool attendant at night. Again very helpful and friendly. Other mentions for excellent staff: Kate and Camille and Zack. Overall, a brilliant stay with excellent staff. Thank you!",10,Nov-21,
Marina Bay Sands,"We went for a 2 hour evening session at the bar by the swimming pool. We had fantastic views of the city and bay as the day turned to night.  We had a few drinks and nibbles. It was all lovely, but as you would expect it comes at an eye-watering cost.  As usual with Singapore there were stringent covid rules.",8,Nov-21,
Marina Bay Sands,"I am writing this mail to compliment the amazing set of crew at the infinity pool. The service rendered to me was out of this world.   I would like to particularly compliment LIFEGUARD KELVIN for providing service over and above the rest. He was extremely helpful and had a lot of initiative. He continuously kept checking on all of the hotel guestsâ safety & comfort. Staff like him should be recognized rendering such top quality service from his heart. He took pride in his work. He is definitely an asset to the company.   Thanks to this wonderful set of crew, I truly enjoyed my experience with your hotel and am definitely coming back and sharing my experience on all social media platforms.   Once again, thank you Marina Bay Sands (Infinity pool team) for the memorable experience.â¦",10,Jan-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"I am basing my review on equivalent hotels worldwide at the price of over $600 a night which what I paid per night.  Firstly I booked a City View and the room has an incredible view, we slept with the blinds open as it was so amazing.  We were on level 35.  The room is good, but not amazing for this price.  The room we had at the Hyatt was double the size for less money and the service was equally as good.  You could only book the famous infinity pool for 1 hour a day that is it and the spaces are limited, so you may end up like many people with a timeslot that is not great.  The gym was the same, you have to book which was relatively simple, but we arrived after the Singapore NY festivities, so it was alot quieter.  For this price, I would expect a little more customer serviceâ¦",6,Jan-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"I booked two rooms for 2 days for my family of 6 under the Sandsational Staycation package over the Christmas holidays. On the MBS website, it says that complimentary breakfast would be provided if you sign up as a Sands Reward Member. What I experienced was having to jump through multiple hoops and walking back and forth between Tower 1 and Tower 3 on multiple occasions to get the breakfast voucher. To the hotel's credit and our pleasant surprise, they allowed us to check in early at 9 a.m. and the process at Tower 3 reception was smooth. However, we were told to go to Tower 1 Sands Rewards counter to get our physical membership card. When I went there in the afternoon, there was a long queue at the counter. I was told that after getting the card, I needed to go to the machineâ¦",4,Dec-21,
Marina Bay Sands,So much for safe distancing when there is no proper waiting area and massive crowd waiting to checkin. Everyone just standing in crowds outside the shops. Massive waiting times to check in. We understand COVID-19 is leading to more checks and measures but to wait 1-2 hours for checkin is really unacceptable.  Service level below average for the supposed top tier hotel. And more long queues for breakfast at the hotel. Management needs to look at themselves as to why there are long queues everywhere. Poor staffing planning. The poor staff are overworked and overwhelmed due to shortage of staff. Looks like the existing staff need to cover 3 persons work at the expense of 1.  Social distancing measures are a joke. Having stayed at other hotels the intrusion of privacy and constantâ¦,4,Dec-21,
Marina Bay Sands,"It was a delighted experience staying at MBS. From checked in all the way to departure, they never disappoint you. The smiles on all the staff just melt your heart, they simply blew you away. To mention a few whom made the impression - Caine from Reception, Adil from Skypark, Housekeeping team who keeps the hotel so clean, despite the hard work, the smiles and greetings from them along the corridor just made you feel welcome! Well done MBS team and kudos to all! We will definitely be back!",10,Jan-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We had a complimentary upgrade and my request for a quiet room was met as it was away from the elevator. The wait till check in was heavily regulated due to Covid but the service was fantastic. I signed up for an MBS membership that same day too. The room was very classy, clean and had a great view of the Gardens by the bay. We booked our pool slot in advance and loved the view from the top too. Despite the ever-changing measures for Covid (we could not dine in at that time), I had to order food as takeaway from restaurants. The food was packed well and I made sure to order it before the dinner crowd arrived. Some of the entrances and exits were a bit confusing though. Having the MBS membership is a plus because it applies to all shops and restaurants in the shoppes and hotel.â¦",10,Jun-21,
Marina Bay Sands,"The stay was a birthday gift from the missus. It went smoothly from checkin to checkout. All the staff were great but a special mention to Moe at the pool.

Marina Bay Sands,It is understood that the views from the infinity pool are awesome. Unsurpassed. What made our visit extra special was the kind attention that Lifeguard Kelvin paid to ensuring that my friends and I captured those special moments.

I even got a complimentary upgrade by signing up as a rewards member which was a nice surprise. The room was extremely clean and contained complimentary drinks and snacks in the mini bar and fridge which gets stocked daily.   The staff here were phenomenal! From housekeeping staff to lifeguards at the pool I was greeted at every entrance, making conversation and genuinely happy to see me. The staff member Ryan (pool lifeguard) did a fantastic effort in making sure my experience at the pool was the best it could be.

We opted for 3 separate staycations and, in order to compare the hotels weâve chosen, the duration for each of our staycations was the same duration and over the same days of different weeks.  Marina Bay Sands was our second staycation.  We had stayed once before but that memory was become fuzzy.  All I could remember was that the restroom was huge.  Actually we didnât plan to stay at the MBS.  However, due to the availability of a promotion, we decided to have our second staycation there â and boy were we glad we did.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Vincent and Aries for taking care of us while we were having afternoon tea and cocktails. We really appreciate their efforts in making sure we were okey while we were at Club55.

We will definitely come back.",10,Feb-22,
Marina Bay Sands,When we checked in I told them it was my birthday. Daniel then told me he had upgraded us to a suite. It was unbelievable! Huge with floor to ceiling windows on both sides and phenomenal views! I will never forget this experience. Dinner at Câest La Vie and a swim in the rooftop pool in the morning topped it all off. I would highly recommend this hotel for a special occasion.,10,Feb-22,

Would definitely return!",10,Sep-22,

Marina Bay Sands,"We booked the Deluxe Garden View room but we were very kindly upgraded to a newly refurbished suite in the second tower. This room blew every other hotel suit out of the water. The suite came with spacious rooms, very modern technology and insane views from both the bedroom and living room. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Only thing I would say I wasnât to keen on would be the breakfast buffet, considering it is very dear, but this could just be down to personal preference.",8,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"Our stay was made so much more special by the staff but in particular, Renee Soh from the Premium Services team. Nothing was a problem and room was like a penthouse. Amazing hotel with amazing staff to match.",10,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"If you are looking for luxurious personal service, this hotel is not for you. The swimming pool view is the highlight but it's not for swimming, it is for posing and taking pictures. We hadn't booked anything because we didn't know we had to and we didn't find a restaurant to eat in before 9pm because everything is fully booked. There doesn't seem to be anyone to help you navigate the madness of so many people so even though as a hotel guest spending a lot of money it doesn't feel like you are important to the hotel. The guest room is a wonderful sanctuary. We had a high view across the gardens and bay which was wonderful but this was not enough to make me want to go back.",6,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"This hotel deserves 5 stars for its sheer size. Our visit was to the MBS was the most impersonal experience I have ever had at any hotel anywhere in the world. When you arrive you are simply one of thousands of other guest who are checking in and out of the hotel that day. The surprising thing is everything does seem to be well managed which is why the place deserves five stars.  It is another thing I have ticked off the bucket list, but as for returning, that wont be happening.",10,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,This was my 2nd time at MBS. I had a great stay. I would like to say that this time I experienced an even better service. The room service was very prompt. The waiting time for breakfast was much less. Also the breakfast selection was very nice.  The staff was very helpful as I had arrived early and the check-in executive gave me a temporary card to access the pool and the health club so I could relax and shower by the time my room was being readied up.  The views from the hotel is undoubtedly amazing.,10,Sep-22,
Marina Bay Sands,We had such a lovely time in MBS! The service is outstanding and the facilities are simply amazing. Singaporeâs best hotel totally did not disappoint. Plus points that we were given a generous upgrade from Garden view to City view.,10,Aug-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"It's an enormous, sprawling hotel, and the check-in experience was similar to checking-in at an airport - not ideal.  However, it was clear after a few encounters with the staff that despite the fact that we were 4 people of thousands of people passing through,  that this hotel was special.  Each interaction with the superb staff felt personal and the staff were fully invested in us having a great time.  I'd single out the following staff for exceptional service:  Concierge (and Clef D'Or holder) -  Muzaffar - he went the extra mile to help us book our night safari Pool-side manager - Maurice (one of the nicest Aussie's I've met) Pool life guard - Mo ( a one in a million character)",10,Jul-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We arrived in Singapore as a family. Beforehand, we arrived to 2 different hotels that were cheap and reliable. When we first arrived to Marina Bay Sands, we were stupefied to see how many adults were in the hotel. At that time, it was school holidays in most parts of the world. The check-in time was at 4:00pm as well. When we first arrived to our room, it was pretty standard for a $1000 SD per night hotel. Nevertheless, the facilities were superior for adults. Consequently, Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel for adults ONLY.",6,Oct-22,
Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for three nights.  This hotel was excellent and as we loved the pool.   However, out of all the hotels I have stayed at, I would like to say a special Thank You to Marina Bay Sands.   On our holiday (we went to a few places), my 10 year old  son became ill and became dehydrated.    By the time we reached Marina Bay Sands, it was becoming obvious that he was not well.    I contacted the front desk and the staff organised an ambulance and a doctor to come to examine him.  Marina Bay Sands security helped take my son in a wheelchair to the ambulance and assisted us with our passports and details we would need to take to the hospital.  The  staff at Marina Bay Sands simply went above and beyond.  My son went onto make  a very speedy recovery after going to A&E at the hospital.  Yes - I thought the room we had was excellent.  The hotel was wonderful and such a good location.    Above all though I would like to say a heartfelt thanks to the staff who really did care about us in our hour of need. I would like to say heartfelt  thank you for making us feel so special and taking care of my son while we visited Singapore.  Thank you.â¦",10,Sep-22,

Marina Bay Sands,"We are a family of 6 ( my 85 yearold father, 79 year old mother, my sis-in-law and his sons flew in from Canada and myself ),the room upgrade (Merlion Suite facing gardens by the bay)was very much appreaciated!My 2 nephews flew in from Canada and were celebratin their birthday as well, so having us all in 1 room was a big surprise as well as  the complimentary cakes.The suite was of course luxurious, the complimentary tea, coffee, drinks and chocolates were a big hit.Booking is simple online, the check-in process could be improve especially for the unintiated like where do we look for the queue numbers although 1 unpleasant encounter was when a guest claimed that our queue number was his and proceeded to the counter , I was baffled as the prompt in my phone stated my check-in was completed already while we are still queueing  up behind the counter. I needed to asked for help for this and turned out the guest claimed he has our queue number, the receptionist just proceeded to check him in without counter-checking like asked him to show the queue number from his phone. Anyway, the staff whom I called for help come to out rescue and all is good again.I am also gratefull that the wheelchair I requested for my 85 year old father was sent straight to the room, shouldâve asked for my 79 year old mother as well If I only knew it would be easy to request.The room service butler was very responsive and the staffs sent to us for assistance for our needs were very respectful, knowledgeable and attentive , kudos to Leah( room -in dining dinner, very promptly she set up our table and has very friendly attitue)Cecil( gave the surprise cakes , she is very amicable and friendly)Nadrajan( our first contact after check-in, he asked if the wheelchair will be used at that time or we prefer to send in to our room and before he left the room he distinctly explained about what butler phone can do,the key cards although he explaine the electricity card but we cannot find the slot he was saying) ,the guy who brought our ice cubes whom I failed to get his name and the one who enlightened us about the electricity acrd which our room does not need to use it,the guy who brought in our breakfast but I failed to get his nameLaura from Infinity pool whom you can tell her sincerity in making sure we are taken cared of , she asked Leo to assist my dad and mom while they are visiting the pool. One not so good experience was during breakfast when we went down to RISE restaurant , our 2 rooms originally booked does not include breakfast but from what Mary staff from check in told us that we can go to RISE or SPAGO for breakfast without reservation, so when we queued up the staff from RISE asked for my name and room number and when she checked our original room has no inclusion of breakfast but I asked if we can still eat and pay , she said no so we just went back to our room and ordered in for room service. I called and checked why we were sent away, the phone butler staff checked then called again and claimed there was no record we approached RISE eventhough restaurant staff asked to spell out my name and after awhile called us to head down with already a table reserved for us but I declined since we already ordered for breakfast room service. I failed to get the RISE staffâs name as we were  already flustered, anyway we moved on after that since we have the breakfast in our room already and proceeded to the Infinity pool, of course the reason we booked at MBS was the pool and we were not disappointed , from the booking for the date slot and the messages sent whether the pool is temporarily closed because of the inclement weather as well as its opening once available is very much helpful and as I mentioned Laura from the Infinity pool is a darling, she is very sincere. The photo also was an experience, the photographer was friendly and does not impose, itâs nice that other than the printed photos, the digital photos were available to the guests. Check-out was easy as can check out from the TV although as 2 rooms initially was booked only  1 room was billed and able to check out from the TV so needed to check put from the front desk , Victor helped us out from the front desk to check out and settle our bill for our stay. The Merlion suite of course has the wow factor already its spacious and clean,the furnitures are comfortable, the mini bar was well equipped, the toilet in the bathroom can have a bidet perhaps , the bathtub is super comfy, the massage room and the hair washing room does not come with any information how to use it though , the downside of staying in the Merlion Suite is we almost refused  to leave the room. The overall experience we had was very memorable, and yes we will come and check-in againâ¦",10,Jul-22,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Stayed in Room on the 6th Floor (2 Floors above Pool). It was an upgrade to my reservation and I was shocked at its condition. The window was covered with algae, so it was not possible to look outside. It had the appearance of a fish tank which hadn't been cleaned in years. It rained during the night and I woke up to water which leaked into the room. Upon inspection, it was obvious that the glass was unsealed and the frame was deteriorated. In the pictures, you can see how they made past plaster repairs which did nothing to solve the leak problem. The room smelled dank from the repeated leaks (Singapore = rain) and their maintenance was clearly incompetent as was obvious from the buckling plastic and cracks. The bed sheets had blood stains. The shower head was broken. There is a 30-45 minute wait (long line forms in lobby) for poor quality food for breakfast (there are several cafes within a 2-3 minute walk so you should definitely leave the hotel for all your food and beverage needs.) This hotel needs to be shut down and totally redone in order to compete with the other - much better - hotel offerings in the area. The Grand Hyatt is presently closed for major renovations because it was unable to compete with all the new hotels in the Orchard area.

Each day we went down and had little to no wait to get seated even though the hotel was very busy. The people at the buffet worked so hard to get tables cleaned, people seated, and the food kept fresh and hot. I was happy to start each day with a solid meal that included a plethora of choices from many cuisines to try. For the rest of the day, there are many dining options nearby, and the MRT was about a 10 min walk up Orchard Rd. The rooms are cozy, and I especially liked the shower. They have self serve washer and dryer, but it did cost me $32 to do one full load through the washer are dryer. Also, there was a decent grocery store on the lower level of this hotel, which was convenient for buying snacks and drinks daily.â¦",10,Sep-22,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Hi. it was a great night to remember. me and my family were really enjoy our dinner buffet at the TOC. We really enjoy the chilli crab at the Chinese Section . Taste everything on point.   But what really make us feel like we are back on 80's @ 90's was the authenctic malay cuisine. we really like the prawn in spicy tumeric gravy with pineapple. really take us back when our late grandma always cook for us when have a chance. The gravy not so thick no so watery it just on point. Spicy level is really nice and taste well. not to forget the okra sambal, superb that i can say.  Kudos to the chef for good food. Surely will comeback for next new authentic menu.   Overall western also really good, Only the indian section everything was really thick where we can really enjoy it. 10 star for food and service. Kudos Orchard Cafe.â¦",10,Sep-22,

From the beginning of our journey till our Big day, we are very happy and satisfied with the hotel staffs professionalism & service. Not to mention the amazing ballroom with spectacular deco.

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Was allocated Orchard Hotel Singapore for my 21 days of quarantine. The last 21 days wasnât the easiest but I am extremely grateful to two helpful individuals that went out of their way to make my stay a better one. Thank you Mr Quam Kponton (Front Office Manager) and Ms Nithya (Duty Manager I believe) for going above and beyond your call of duty.   I had a severe allergic reaction in my room on my first day of arrival and had to teleconsult my doctor as we arenât able to step out of our room during our SHN period. Initially in the evening, I wasnât able to get the help I needed and I had to put up with the night. However my allergy reaction got so bad in the middle of the night that I had to called the call centre at 4am for assistance. I am so thankful for Ms. Nithya who tried her very best to get me the items I needed and even ensure follow up assistance was given properly. Not forgetting Mr. Quam who had been taking care of me throughout the 21 days of my SHN and checking on me and my condition - both of you are truly gems of Orchard Hotel!â¦",10,Apr-21,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Thank you to Miucia and Yen for the services while having a staycation with my family. I booked 2 rooms as I am staying over with 3 others of my family members. I requested for rooms on the same floor as my mom preferred to have us on the same floor. They do advise us on the strict guidelines that we have to adhere and it is not a big problem from us. The housekeeping team on that floor was good too! On the second day, I did not require any make up room as I just checked in late the day before, but they gave a courtesy call to ask if we needed anything extra. Worth every penny and all the staffs Iâve met or talked to are friendly and helpful.

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We had a pleasant stay during my birthday at Orchard Hotel and that is why my husband and I decided to have our wedding at Orchard Hotel.   Initially, there were a little hiccups here and there as the person in-charge of our wedding kept changing within a year. We were very worried when our wedding date is approaching and we do not even know who to contact.  Thankfully, we have Sunshine, our wedding coordinator. Even though she is new, she is responsive to our messages and email. She is also responsible to keep us updated of our external wedding set-ups by sending us photos to keep us reassured.   Special thanks to Mr Arifin and his team for allowing us to test our montage and he even guided us on how to walk down the aisle before our actual day. We are very thankful to meet Mr Arifin as he is skilful and he knows what he is doing. When he knows that we have a musical band, he reminded us to tell our coordinator to set-up a stage for them which is really nice of him as we had no clue on what is expected.  We were glad that everything went smoothly on our actual wedding day and we would like to express our gratitude once again to Sunshine for coordinating, Mr Arifin and his team for AV,  ops manager and the rest of the  staff at Orchard Hotel who helped us out during our big day.â¦",10,Sep-22,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"I don't understand how this hotel gets soaring reviews from all its quarantine guests, my experience here thus far is summarized by one word - stifling.  I've been assigned to this hotel for my 14 nights SHN quarantine, naturally I understand that rooms cannot be chosen, as they are assigned accordingly. When I entered the room, my heart sank a little because the room is incredibly small - on par with those micro hotel rooms that I've stayed in Tokyo and New York. It's advertised as 28sqm online, but I fear it's actually smaller.

F&B is the biggest letdown, afternoon tea is nowhere near the quality of other hotel, kinda feel like leftover food from buffet due to weird combination of food items with cakes, sushi, curry puff, popiah, sandwich and without scone. Breakfast is probably the worst part of the hotel since we were notified to have our breakfast packed from orchard cafe to be consumed in room. This is P3HA instead of P2HA yet they don't allow dining in of breakfast buffet. The queue of the breakfast was very long, the spread of the breakfast is very poor for a 4-star hotel.

Lovely bed, very comfy. A variety of TV channels available. They even had both bathtub and shower stand. The usual amenities - toothbrush, shower gel, conditioner, shampoo, soap, shower cap, vanity kit and lotion were provided.

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"A good hotel, nothing special despite all the glamour of the reception. The room is smaller than anticipated and as is the bathroom. The breakfast and the service is appalling. Each day we had to queue in the lobby for 20 minutes or more (no exaggeration as I timed each day) before we were even seated.  Then queuing for the coffee machine (which wasnât particularly good) and then rushing round in a frantic small area to get the food. I complained to cancel our breakfast addition, but told we couldnât because booked through Hotels.Com.  This is a poor approach to customer service. I was also promised that a senior manager would call me the following morning to discuss. That never happened either. I am very disappointed in such poor standards especially for a hotel in Singapore.â¦",4,Jun-22,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Could hear my neighbours so good luck if you're a light sleeper.   I like this hotel because it's cheaper (and further) for Orchard, and I like the room with the bathtub although the bathtub being curved is a bit hazardous for the elderly who can't balance.   Check-in is laborious and slow despite doing pre-check-in. I'm told the deposit held of 500 for a night was a bit steep by my peers. Still, it was used to pay off for the stay, instead of a deposit on top of the night's stay.  Was annoyed that the M1 promo code did not work. Hope you choose a better partner or implement your promo codes better next time.

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),I had a chance to stay at orchard on a business trip but experience was not awesome. Room amenities were good and functional but hotel needs service attitude. We had to wait everyday minimum 5-10 minutes for breakfast seating once even for more than half an hour. Also Indian breakfast spread needs improvement. Swimming pool was ok but there was no changing room or lockers causing huge inconvenience. They charged us one full day for checking in at 9 Am instead of 3 pm but not willing to extend check out to3 p.m. last day without charging for half a day .

All-in-all it was a good experience, the things I appreciated the most was the size of the well appointed room (Room 1346), which is rare in Singapore for this price point. Also, the location and morning breakfast was good. The staff are polite and efficient. We were happy with the property for our requirements.  The only two issues - our bathroom did not have an exhaust fan, which is a must in such a modern hotel. And secondly, we had trouble with the rooms cooling, but we must stress this was also addressed immediately. Both these observations point to a slightly older construction and ageing property, which may need some serious touch-ups.

Shortage of staff at reception and concierge at times was frustrating with no apology ever. They have got this wrong. Breakfast was a total scrum every day with long queues to get a table after 8am. Have your breakfast early.  Actual food was ok - typical variety, but experience is spoilt by the scrum. Hotel is 5 minutes walk from Orchard MRT so very convenient location, albeit that on walking back to the hotel from the MRT later at night you will encounter prostitutes in front of Orchard Towers at the junction between Orchard Road and Claymore Road.

The stay was so comfy that I didn't want to leave. ð I had an awesome view of the pool, which made me jealous of the other staycation guest enjoying sun tanning or swimming.  Thank you Darren, Mr Santhanam and other colleagues for the good work and taking care of all the SHN guests. I think you delivered so much food to my room, you can probably memorise my room number or probably go Alamak!!  This room again ah!!!   Met Mr Quam Kponton and his other colleague on checkout and had a little chat. It's nice to have human interaction after 21days in my own bubble.  Thank you for helping me with my heavy luggages..

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"First time staying in a hotel in Singapore and it was pleasant. Check in was smooth and staffs were friendly. Was here with my friend so we decided to get a bigger room, the room had access to the lounge as well as complimentary laundry which was good. We came to the lounge almost everyday for tea and evening cocktails and was always greeted by the staffs. Ian the staff that served us most of the time was brilliant. He was quite shy but we still managed to talk to him and he always puts a smile on my face. At the same time, Yen another staff is a very good role model for others as she always maintain a high quality of standards that will certainly contribute to this hotel's business. We will certainly be back again.",6,Jul-22,

Requested for a pen as my brother wanted to draw and it took quite awhile but totally understandable as it was in the middle of the night.   Thank you for the great service! Will definitely come back!,10,Sep-21,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"I booked a room for 2 nights for my partnerâs birthday celebration, and had a lot of preplanning that was yet to be done before they arrived. I had to rush off to pick up my partner after work, and went to the front desk to seek help on whether it was possible to get the room set up (balloons mainly) as I was running late and would not be able to do so myself. The girl mending the front desk, Amanda, personally went beyond the means to go up to get my room set up for me herself. I was so touched and impressed by the initiative she took, despite being busy and was not required for her to do so. My partner was really touched by everything, and I have to thank Amanda for her big part in it. Thank you for making my staycation such a wonderful experience. I hope you get recognizedâ¦",10,Aug-21,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"The hotel was fined $1000 by STB for breaching the limit for gathering. Hence the hotel had $100 promotion for premier room to attract more sales. There is a staff manning the premier and deluxe wing respectively after their fines. Previously, stayed there 3 times, there wasnt this measure. The staff would ensure that all guest have register themselves, including visitors. He would also ask for your room number. Just like Royal Plaza Hotel in HK, where the staff would ""mark attendance"", to ensure that not more than x number of guest + visitors are going into the room.   Check in time is at 3pm, and check out time is at 11am. The premier room is bigger than the deluxe room. however the deluxe room is more recently renovated .

Its a complete NO for your vacations. They even Refused to give milk for toddler, didn't respond when we were at restaurant for breakfast.

In view of the peak period we anticipated delays etc. And it was not that bad at all that we need to wait for our room to be ready (within 30mins). As a guest, it is only fair we managed our own expectations during this pandemic especially when Orchard Hotel is also a SHN facility and for sure with limited staff strength. But what really gets to me positively during this stay is their IT department.  So we brought our gaming system and decided to plug in and realized that the hotel had set some restrictions to its wifi network.

I continued to ask him what were the other request that other people asked for, and he said like higher floors, better views etc. I told him, if its possible then I will like to request for that too! But if it was not possible, it was fine as I donât want to mafan him, so whatever will do.

Since this hotel seems to be very popular with conventions and group tours that have a pre-paid breakfast, we did not wait in the long lines at the buffet in the morning.  My only complaint would be the lack of dining options other than the very expensive buffet in the restaurant.  There may have been snacks in the bar but it didn't seem to be a good place to eat with my granddaughter.  There are several nearby casual restaurants and also a grocery in the basement as breakfast or small meal options.

Bed was not comfortable though - instead of a queen bed, 2 twin beds was simply just pushed together with a bedsheet on top (be ready to fall into the hole in between, or be poked by the uneven corner, if you're sleeping in the middle.)

Service:
Staff are friendly and nice and they go the extra mile where they can (provided a cake for anniversary, appreciated). But basic on essentials (eg. Ice is chargeable at $5).

Breakfast:
Not worth the added cost. Basic (bread, yogurt, cereal, with one main of choice); really nothing special (you'd definitely get much better value going out for a traditional local breakfast), and a little slow (you can see staff trying their best though).

Location:
For drivers, note that you have to come in from Orchard road. Google maps will lead you to Claymore road which you will not be able to access the hotel from. The carpark has an awkward entrance, is small and lots next to walls are ridiculously tight. Central but no longer the heart of Singapore.

Overall:
Alright if you're just looking for a regular stay. Nothing exceptional.",6,10-Jan-21,

Nobody was updating us anything and left us waiting for that long. Poor service by the front desk staffs, as always disappointing. There was no solution given to the guests and made us wait while they ignore us totally. 
6.10pm finally the room is ready for check-in. 
A little bit of smile and updates could've made my stay better. 
Mornings can be pretty noisy from outside your rooms. You can hear the housekeeping team shouting back and forth.

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"1. The international breakfast is hilariously lousy. Dual standard of managing SOPs.

2. At first, front desk officer lied about the room facts. I requested a room change and yet that front desk officer Ms C.... Yam pretend not remember what she said earlier. Luckily, I approached another front desk officer, Ms Queenie and many thanks to her who is sincere to solve my problem. 

3. Orchard Wing is suck and very small room even though it is newly renovated. Highly recommended Claymore Wing which has spacious room and not that old renovation, good for family stay.
",6,4-Apr-21,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),First the sink in the room choked and we needed to call for plumbing service. Then there was leakage in our room coming from the ceiling. We requested for a change of room and only got a new room ready at 10pm. It was very inconvient as the other room was located at the other wing. They did not even offer any compensation for the inconvient caused. We had to personally call to make noise to request for late check out. We were quite happy with the new room until another prob came in the morning. The toilet choked and we couldnt flush down anything. My 3 year old daughter have to use the toilet at the lobby instead. We were so turn off with the terrible plumbing system that we cant even bother to report it. We packed our bags and left way before the check out time. Defintely not staying there again.,2,5-Apr-21,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Asking too much of personal details before check in you have fill up a form then you have to indicate where you working plus need to give your superior contact details for no reason at all,8,6-Aug-21,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Not much to cheer about for this hotel compared to the last few Staycations we did this year. Nothing much has changed in this hotel.  With COVID precautions in place access to the shops and Cold Storage next door has been closed. Just the basics. A coffee machine in the room with fresh coffee would have been good.  Breakfast was uninteresting with little choices. Bread and pastries in the bread basket were not even warm. Guess it was planned for the Chinese tourists takeaway whom we saw leaving on both mornings. ,6,6-Sep-21,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),really value for money 4star hotel. location is alright.near to many shops. great friendly Staff and room was nice and clean ,8,9-Sep-21,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Nice vibe,8,17-Jun-21,
Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"On the hotel website, it states that we could pre-book our check in time so that the check in process is faster. However, when we reached the lobby, they mentioned that we have to queue together with others. Then isn't it redundant for us to pre-book the slot when there isn't any difference. On the bright side is that the staff are friendly and the queueing for the check in is not that long, around 20 mins. 

I am quite disappointed with the cleaniness of the room. The glass mug in the bathroom has lipstick stain and the blanket has few stains mark on it. It looks like small dots of dried blood stains. ",6,15-Mar-21,

Had to come to the front desk to be sorted after getting to my room. Wasn't expecting this from the good reviews of the hotel. Couch wasn't the cleanest either. I didn't kick up a fuss as we just wanted to relax. Hope the hotel does better in future.",4,4-Jan-21,

Orchard Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"A comfortable option for a brief staycation. Most importantly during these times, cleanliness was not a problem. Bed was very comfortable and gave us a good night's sleep. Club room in the Claymore Wing felt in need of some updates - decor and furniture are both a little dated. Customer service upon check in was somewhat disappointing - none of my requests sent via direct messaging were tended to, and when I raised them, it felt like I was being a hassle. Food at breakfast time was fair, not great. Overall it was fine, but I would question another such stay at the hotel.",8,6-Jan-21,

Check in took about 7-10mins due to long queue.
Well maintaining and not so dusty room neither moldy bathroom. Kids loved tent and sofa bed also.
But, checkout date, we found a needle on the floor between tv and luggage stand. This is totally unacceptable case especially if you stay with small kids. I have reported to receptionist.

We paid $450 not including breakfast. Well, if the price is below the $400, we will give 5***** for our staycation.

During the check in time, there was an email sent to me by hotel saying cake wont be given again!! i have asked the check in counter staff and he says he will send up to the room. again it wasnt sent. the i have ordered in room dining.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore (SG Clean)","The hotel has been acquired by the Pan Pacific group and the quality is much lower than before. Especially the service during the breakfast where the prosucts are no more so exceptional. Eggs are always cold, chicken sausage in the water is a crime and one fruit jam ridiculous. Bread is porr quality and the chinese noodle soup has no flavour. By Ruth, prices are out of range, but at least the beef fillet was well cooked and good quality. The baked potato was mashed  and the traditional sour cream with parsley had disappeared.... The room service did a good job, however you need to know almost all beds are equipped with wheels and are nit fixed or blocked. So if you love dancing in the night, enjoy it! Finally a good point for the concierge team who did a very good work.",6,Jul-22,

Unfortunately, song birds in small cages dotted througout the hotel detracted from my enjoyment. Yes - they make a beautiful noise, but regardelss of how well the birds are looked after, no animal should be kept in such a confined space for prolongued periods of time. It made me feel sad and uncomfortable (which isn't the experience I was looking for!) I did address this with the hotel directly.   If the birds were removed, I would stay again and rate highly.

Doesnât deliver package or food to your room, housekeeping service sometimes donât clean your cups, laundry service charge you 4 pairs AFTER you have called and confirm there is only 3.5 pairs and only to be charged 3 pairs. Booked Portmanâs bar for an event 2 weeks before, one day before the vent, Portman staff told me donât have this reservationâ¦  NEVER enough staff at Portmanâs bar, I go there everyday for meeting and I have to go find people to help me.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore (SG Clean)","The ParkRoyal Marina Bay (PRMB) was opened end of last year following a renovation and we dropped by for a 1 nite staycation in May. The hotel was still in their soft opening phase as there are still some areas undergoing renovations such as part of the swimming pool area and the suites.  Checking in was a breeze and a great delight as there is no queue, possibly due to reduced staycation guests as a result of the Phase 2 Heightened Alert. We will also like to commend the PRMB team which has always been prompt in replying our emails prior to the stay and such customer service is what makes the hotel stand out.  The room we purchased was the Signature Marina Bay room, which was supposedly their highest tier room this moment as the suites are still undergoing renovation. Unfortunately the room we were being allocated did not have a direct view of the bay. The bay could only be sighted from an angle at the balcony. Within the room, the direct view was actually overlooking Mandarin Oriental instead.  The room was freshly renovated and adopts a minimalist style. Though the PRMB website stated its room size as 32 square metres, it looked considerably smaller than the rooms of similar grade hotels. Also as it is supposedly a higher tier room, we are expecting a bit more furnishing such as a business desk and chair and probably a one seater sofa.   The in-room fridge was however cleverly designed to be placed at a height where guests could just open the fridge without needing to bend down. One of the most essential items in a hotel room is the bed and the bed at PRMB was of a nice firmness.  The washroom was of a good size where there are also a bathtub, however, the shower cubicle surface area was awkward as there was a pillar that âjagged outâ and took up nearly 20% of the cubicle space. Post renovation I was also surprised to see that the shower cubicle does not come with a rain shower which is the norm in hotels nowadays. In addition, the toilet bowl was surprisingly low in height and was not very comfortable for a grown adult, at least myself.  This is my second stay at a ParkRoyal within a 3 months period and it appeared that their chain is switching to filtered water tap instead of providing bottled water. Personally I prefer bottled water as I donât trust the water quality from filtered water tap as it is largely dependent on how frequent the filter are being changed and also how frequent and intensive is the servicing done on the filtered system hoses.  Though our room does not come with meals, we were given breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapÃ©s. We are not certain if these were given due to our GHA status (as no room upgrade as ours was already the highest tier available) or if it was given to all room guests due to no dining-in in the in-house restaurants. In any case it was a very kind gesture of the hotel.  Also as our room package was the Feast and Eat one which comes with a $400 credit, it was essentially 6 meals in 1.5 days (including the complimentary evening canapÃ©s etc.). While Peach Blossom food was great, Peppermint puts up a strong fight with its lobster laksa and Halibut fish and chips.   There are two areas whereby some tweaking or improvements will be welcomed. Firstly it will be better if Peach Blossom could cover up their dishes with covers or cling wrap them before delivering to the room, especially in a pandemic period. Next, the food items available in the app was far lesser as compared when making a call to the hotline, as such, the hotel could perhaps consider beefing up the ordering menu in the app itself.  Since it was Phase 2 HA we didnât go around touring the hotel and the only place we went to was the pool. It was of a nice size due to limited visitors but if the hotel will to go back to full capacity, the pool might be too small for personal comfort. We went for a nite swim on the first day of our stay as we heard that there will be âstarsâ (lights) in the pool but to be honest it did not really awe us very much.  All in all this was a great staycation to relax with lots of movies and food. Should the hotel be ranked solely based on the infrastructure it may not be able to match that offered by its more known competitors but what makes it stand out is its customer service, starting from the front desk to the room service delivery personnel and ending off with the concierge.  Will I revisit again? Definitely yes and very soon in the near future.â¦",10,Apr-21,

In redesigning the bedrooms, the new owners have clearly forgotten that guests have clothing, books, paraphernalia, electronic equipment, etc. The cupboard space is limited and there are no drawers in which to place anything that cannot be suspended in the limited hanging space. We stayed here for 4 nights, returning after a quick visit to Malaysia for a further 6 nights. During our first stay, staff very kindly brought us an empty filing cabinet so that we were not constrained  to arrange assorted belongings on the floor.

During our stay, my wife fell and fractured her hip (not in the hotel). The staff here have been superb in supporting both of us with genuine concern and wonderful care.

Level 4, where the reception is located, is spectacular, with hanging sculpture and gardens. The room was very clean and had a balcony and harbour views, which I appreciated.  It was much more spacious than many other Singapore hotel rooms I've experienced, styled in a sparse, modern style, with no nod to location.

Breakfast is above average but nothing extravagant. We enjoyed our stay but can't say I'd choose this hotel again on our next visit.

We had two (2) adjoining rooms on the 20th floor that had spectacular views of the bay and the race track! Both rooms were spotlessly clean and well appointed. Our rooms were collections rooms with club lounge access. The lounge was lovely for breakfast, drinks and snacks. The pool area is on the same level as the lounge and we spent a lot of time on this level. The pool is amazing! I was thoroughly impressed by this hotel for all of the reasons outlined above, we had a lovely stay.

She said that I need to request it from any waiter around my dining area and guests are not allowed to request it from the coffee corner (the area was accessible).

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore (SG Clean)","We had to queue for an hour and a half before checking in. Maybe it was a full occupancy weekend, so we could not get 2 rooms next to each other. Fortunately the room for my girls was ready to check in but our other room was not ready until after 8pm.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore (SG Clean)","Just returned from my staycay at Parkroyal Marina Bay yesterday. Honestly I wouldnt return again or maybe not during a sch holiday at least. 
I started the Q to check in around 215pm but only got my room abt 2 hrs later. When I reached the counter, I was informed that my room was not ready & that because of the room category which I booked which is the suite, check-in is done at a separate counter on Level 5 instead of Level 4 where I originally queued at. 
The start was already not going well. I went to Level 5 and was told that the room was still not ready so the staff offered meal vouchers at the Portsman Bar which was at Level 4. So off my family went back to Lvl 4 where we sat. The staff initially only offered drinks & after some time we had to request on exactly what the meal vouchers entitled us to cos it was already past 3pm & we havent had lunch yet. We were finally served with some high tea but had to wait some time after that before finally getting our room.
Since we could only book the facilities including swimming pool upon scanning QR code in the room, by the time there wasnt anymore slots for the day & the only one available before check out was at an ungodly hour of 7am the nx day. 
I didnt recall having booked a stay that included bfast but perhaps the hotel included it in as a form of compensation for the long waiting time of the room. Bfast the next day was surprisingly buffet style albeit being served by the hotel staff.",6,24-Nov-21,

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore (SG Clean)","Is a disappointing stay for my staycation. During check-in the reception was rude. Did not answer my question directly, and not even eye contact. Her name is Doris.

The room condition was not comfortable at all. There are two bright lights that is directly above the bed headboard. The light are very glaring and making me feel headache. The room light switch is not a dimmer switch, hence you cannot control the light brightness.

If you switch off the light, the room would be dark to watch the TV. 

Due to Covid-19, going to the Gym need to made booking, I called the reception to make a booking and was told gym was full, so I need to wait for 1hr.

I agreed, but I went down to 5 floor to take a look at the gym. No one was in the Gym !!! 

In the toilet, there is a bidet bowl. while I was using it, I turn on the tap, yellowish water came out for few second then the comes the clean running water. This makes me think, did the chamber maid clean the bidet bowl? 

There are some TV channel one of my favorite is History, but it was ""hang"" I can't watch at all. I have to watch other channel.

This hotel was Marina Mandarin, in the past the room was carpeted flooring. But my room was not.

The hotel gave me a late check out, however that did not make up for the lousy service. LOUSY, yes. I use the word lousy.

The breakfast are not what they used to be. Value for money is not really there. No table service for Tea/coffee and used plates were left for a while.  Staff were not overly friendly especially the egg chef. Also the orange juice and milk were always very low and the fruit selection a little lean.

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Took some time to provide feedback on my experience but only to be replied by a computerize response. I was not expecting any form of service recovery. But certainly not this.   I held my wedding banquet held at Park Royal beach road in September 2022 and  would like to give my compliments and feedback to the following staff in chronological order. Starting from the point where my wife and I signed for a wedding package from your road show.   We signed our package with Kellen whom was very insincere in our dealings, we had to remind her about our monthly payments and request for updates on the wedding plans. When Felicia took over as our coordinator, she was very warm and friendly. With her years of experience, she also generously provided great tips on our wedding preparationsâ¦",2,Sep-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,Dated room with dirty couch which was a far cry from the modern and refreshed lobby. But service recovery was efficient and generous which was very appreciated. Club Lounge service was pleasant but last calls were made 20mins prior which I felt was a little too early and the F&B were being packed away 5mins ahead of the 8pm end time. Breakfast at Ginger was nice variety but quality of food left much to be desired.    Complete review and pics on Satu Kosong Travel Blog.,6,Sep-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Rooms are great, service is exceptional!  The bar is brilliant and the bar staff very friendly they also infuse their own liquor that they are more than happy to let you taste. The buffet restaurant is also brilliant and the food was great catering for all tastes. The roof top pool is a wonderful temperature and a great way to cool off from the heat and humidity of Singapore.  The gym is great! I didnât have a chance to use the spa facility but it looked very good.  I visited for work and stayed 4 nights here and would 100% recommend for business or leisure travel. Across the street there is some great bars and little shops. Taxis are always ready and waiting outside and are cheap and convenient way to move around the city.",10,Aug-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,This is the second time we've stayed at this hotel. We like the Kampong Glam area just across the road and the pool is great for swimming laps. Our room was a little tired with no view to speak of but the bed was big and comfy. I liked that filtered water was available in the bathroom. The staff were very helpful and the bar and restaurant very good. Walking distance to Bugis too. ,8,Sep-22,

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Today is the first time staying in Park Royal beach road. I had alighted my family near the lobby area as there quite a few luggage and my wife is required to check in. However I never expect the carpark was near the lobby. The carpark was fully parked with car and there was quite a lot of reserved carpark. I approach one of the staff if he was able to release one of the car park lot as I was staying in the hotel. He told me it was meant for guest who patron the restaurant and wedding guest. âI was thinking in my heart I was also a guest of the hotel. Shouldnât you offer one lot when all the reserved lot was not even occupied.â He ask me to park my car in Pan Pacific Service Suite as it was part of Pan Pacific Group.

Meanwhile I was explained about my privilege, receiving room upgrade in honor of my TITANIUM member status. When departure, the checkout process was fast and easy.  I was greeted with smiles and treated as a valuable GHA member during the entire checkin & out process. I was very satisfied about my stay at this time.

The bed was amazing, I need to buy the same mattress for home, it was so comfortable. The pool area is nice and clean with plenty of sun beds and parasols",10,Oct-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,What a great location for access to the F1 track. Also loved the access to the restaurants on the other side of beach road. Staff and facilities were very good. Would stay again.  Only one small comment. Bathrooms were small and in need of an upgrade. We understand that the Hotel has had a complete face lift BU bathrooms could do with an overhaul.,10,Sep-22,

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Staff were very accommodating and kind. We requested to have early check in when we arrived at the hotel at 12nn. The attendant immediately gave us a room to check in even though check-in should be at 3pm. It was weekend before F1 racing and allowing us to check in early was a gift. I also forgot my key card late in the evening. The lone staff accommodated my request for a new one quickly.  A room with a view of the city and hand towels plus a bath tub in the bathroom would have upped the experience for me and my partner for our vacation and Singapore Improv Festival stay. We also had some initial issues with connecting with hotel internet. Quick phonecalls immediately addressed our concerns -- request for hand towels, internet connectivity, shaving kit.  Breakfast had a good selection of local dishes and intercontinental choices. Clean and comfy. Bugis spots for local food and the commercial mall are very accessible too.â¦",10,Sep-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Although clean and tidy with an impressive frontage and pool on 4th floor.  This hotel is only 6 floors and if in a rear room floors 1-4 only have views of a multi storey car park wall.  Extensive breakfast although staff all appeared very serious, not very warm and friendly.  Initially dealt with by a very friendly and helpful female receptionist until the male colleague seemed to cut across her and rudely take over. Male receptionist stated hotel did not recognise celebrations as they werenât in Sept, despite it being a combined 60th birthday our ruby wedding anniversary and my father in laws 90th, where we had chosen a month between the 4 month date range.  Room - bathroom  facilities were inconsistent with towels. Two bath towels, no hand towels or flannels. Had to ask for hand towels and thereafter each day was hit and miss as to what combination we would get.  After the first night my father in law received a bill for not returning an umbrella despite the fact we hadnât been at the hotel at the time. Slight admin cliche but felt like you were being accused of theft. It was sorted very quickly by the male receptionist.  Personally if you just want a room to crash at itâs ok with good bus and rail links nearby. I see this more as a business hotel that is no more than 3.5* As a result I would not use it again but would get something nearer to the centre with better standards.â¦",6,Sep-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,(1) Overall very good. Little higher on tariff side. The staff need to be little more smiling and courteous. (2) Little more Asian / Indian dishes on Menu.

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"My first staycation with this property was in Dec 2019 and it was a positive one. Hence, we returned for a night of staycation in Apr 2021 as we managed to snag a good deal for the Club room.   Hotel was newly renovated and decor was nice. Teddy bears placed on the sofa seats at the check-in lobby was an instant draw for the kids.   Everything went smoothly - check-in process was fast and we enjoyed the club access with food & drinks sent to our room. Our room came with a balcony. It was clean and well-maintained. We had a good view, facing the Singapore Flyer.    It was all great until breakfast next morning.

One for myself and another room for my parents. They told me my room was ready but I have to wait for their call for my parents room. My parents wanted to rest in their room but had to wait in my room as there was no choice.

During the stay itself, we had to wait for an hour for our room as it was a high occupancy weekend. After an hour, Mr Allen,  who checked us in, approached us to inform that we were upgraded to a suite! The suite was massive and clean. The bed was huge and comfortable! We were given truffles and dried mango and more chocolates!  The light dinner which was included in the rooms package was delicious and tender :) Breakfast choices were varied and allowed you to have more than one serving. All in all, despite the high occupancy, the service given was not compromised. Thank you Mr Allen and team!",10,Apr-21,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Went during the weekend, however probably because it was a long holiday weekend, the lobby was very crowded with barely any safe distancing in place. Arrived at 3pm (actual check in time stated) Queued and waited for 40 mins to get to the registration table (3:40pm) yet was told that I have to wait further 30 minutes to get my room and was told âOh itâs from 3pm and onwards not 3pm exactly so it can be later too.â   Probably as there were not much staffs too, there was no 1m safe distancing at all and the whole lobby was packed. The first impression and experience at the hotel was not great. There were no after service at all even though I was faced with such a bad experience.",4,Apr-21,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"The staffs are friendly, attentive, helpful and professional. The hotel has a welcoming and homely atmosphere with comfortable sofas and chairs while waiting. I would suggest to have water cooler for guest to drink while waiting at the lobby.   Breakfast is good but  the menu seems to be static been eating the same breakfast since my 2 previous stay. Suggest the menu to change more frequently. Maybe daily changes to 1 or 2 main dishes.   The rooms are clean and comfortable, we love the huge bed and comfortable covers.   The location of the hotel is close to many heritage sites and so many different food choices we had problems choosing which food to eat ð.   Overall we had an enjoyable stay.  ",10,Mar-21,

But we do want to get away from our daily busy lives and give our daughter a break so that she can have fun swimming her heart out in the hotel swimming pool. So the very reason why we choose Parkroyal at Beach Road is because the location is really convient for food. When we do staycation, we really just stay in the premises of the hotel because our daughter refuse to go out of the room as she really like playing in the room.

The check-in was smooth and we managed to get both rooms immediately. A 1pm check out was also extended after we requested for a late check out.  While the hotel exterior appeared aged, its rooms have appeared to be refurbished recently and offer a comfortable stay.

We were a family of 4 so paid to upgrade to a junior suite and received a further upgrade to the executive suite. Very nice surprise. Extra beds can be a little expensive but with the complimentary upgraded room the end price was amazing value. Raj processed the upgrade, helped us to check in and was fantastic through the whole say. I cannot commend him highly enough.  The executive suite is clean, modern, very spacious and nicely equipped with a small kitchen, second toilet, and large bathroom and wardrobe. Some nice touches with a small snack tray to welcome us.

I asked for an upgrade, they tried tried look for a room but unfortunately, it being the March school holidays, the hotel was running almost at a full capacity and we did not have any rooms available.

We are thankful for the customer service staff who helped us find slot in the pool before we check out the hotel. So far our stay is great except for the breakfast at Ginger restaurant.

The prices are competitive.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  We particularly liked the superior rm on the larger side. Why we have always booked the Premier Orchid is primarily for the tbathtub, club benefits as well as learning experiences, thus it was a small disappointment that we didn't have it (Phase 2).   The club dinner was a bit lacking this time because we liked the 3 courses meal such as pumpkin soup, steak and dessert.  This round it was primarily fried dishes with salad and dessert.  We find this greasy. Nonetheless, having the play station and the pool was the highlight  for the family. â¦",8,Jun-21,

We had access to the Club Lounge and the service by Maezel, Maja and Nabila kick-started our night off on a good note thanks to their impeccable and cheerful demeanour rendered.

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Overall it was a bad stay and I will tell all my friends and family not to go for this hotel. We signed up for the Couples Retreat package, which was advertised and indicated that it includes daily workshops and evening cocktails served on wheels to our room. However, upon check-in, we were informed that 1) the workshops are only conducted during weekends (our stay was from Sunday to Tuesday), 2) the only workshop that was available during our stay period was for kids, and 3) the evening cocktails are served in the lounge instead of on wheels in-room. All of these totally fell short of our expectation of the Couples Tetreat package we signed up for!

I have to ask him where and what time is the breakfast or and how to book the pool, apparently breakfast also needs to be booked and he just then told us that there is a qr code in the room. He also did not say that we can go to the club lounge and did not inform us that it was 11am-5pm so we missed it on the 1st day. For a receptionist, it was not very welcoming.

I like the filtered water tap provided in the hotel room ... so that I can replenish my water anytime.  The breakfast was fantastic. Most hotelsâ breakfasts and club lounge benefits  during this COVID-19 period are rather disappointing but the breakfast in this hotel is surprisingly good! I love the nasi lemak that comes with lobster and the mee siam with prawns as big as lobster (Thai prawns, I think). The American breakfast was nice too! I  miss buffet breakfast  so was happy that I could ask for 2nd and 3rd round.. I The beverages were good!   The bento set at club lounge was surprisingly good; really appetizing!

I called the front desk and Ray Kok was immediately at my door and understood my disappointment. Immediately he arranged to change and upgrade my room so that I was completely satisfied. Well done Ray, thanks your the best!  The pool is the best large deep and great views. Pools at hotels in Singapore tend to be small and shallow so if like me you enjoying swimming and lazing by the pool this hotel is a great choice.  The other best part is location! Right opposite Arab St for all the great Turkish food but also Thai and other cuisines.",10,May-21,

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Personally, my experience was quite unpleasant. The hotel itself is really nice and is good enough for a 4-star. However, the receptionist has not been the most helpful. I went for a company-sponsored trip which is why the company made the reservation through the company corporate card in the first place. However, when I was checking in, I was told that I needed to provide a one thousand dollar deposit. I find this quite unusual as the amount of the entire stay is only about 809 SGD. Where I come from, the cash deposit is usually less than 20% of the amount of the entire stay.

I was given an upgrade to Deluxe Room due to my Discovery membership and my 1st staying in this category which I would rate it : Wonderful !  The room was spacious along with a comfortable King Size Bed and a nice sofa to relax to watch TV or have a snack by the table. Ample space for my kids to relax n do their stuff on the carpet floor.  Only downside is the bathroom which was small by that room category standard. But it was still comfortable using it with the rain shower and amenities are stocked well.   ,10,Jul-22,

We got access to another pool but that's not the pool we are paying for. - Some noisy works being done in the room next door. - Same workers applied product with very strong smell (i suspect varnish or similar) that leaves us no choice but to leave the window open or have to go out of the room. I guess they are polishing the floor which in our room seemed a bit tired indeed. - Some wires exposed in the bathroom under the mirror on the left,6,Jul-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Very smooth and quick check in service.   Good location.   However, the surrounding area is under construction and takes a detour to get back to the hotel.   This is nothing to do with the hotel however is good to note you may need to walk a bit more.",8,Jul-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,Try other hotels with the same cost. Poor staff from check in to check out. Smell construction paint everywhere. No amenity and shower gel filled up even asked. In room carpet is dirty and full of dusts. Avoid this hotel and try other places with the same price.,4,Jul-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Jessie, who processed my check-in, made me feel welcomed, with her smiles and patience. The room was very clean and bed super comfy!

Except for one lady, who served at the club lounge, is really nice and friendly. She always greet customers and serve drinks when the glasses are empty. The other staff are with room of improvement. I was told that the hotel has been renovated. Can see the changes but could be better. I believe ParkRoyal can improve better in management of the hotels.",6,Aug-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"A quick one night transit stay in a king room. Bed and pillows excellent. In room tech including wifi good. Small couch was very hard though and not one to sit and watch TV for any length of time. Aircon was effective and held our desired temp. Overall room was modern, quiet with excellent block out blinds keeping the room nice and dark.  Lost a rating point in the bathroom however. While modern, bathroom mirror fogs over quickly when using the shower, and the shower had a number of black mold areas clearly evident which need some treatment. There was also no soap for the hand basin. Okay for short stays.",8,Aug-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"For years, whenever we had stopover in Singapore, weâve been returning to ParkRoyal on Beach Road, feeling as if we were coming home. Its workings in all aspects of hospitality - excellent rooms, first class breakfasts, crisp linen, quick and pleasant check-ins and check-outs,all this is done efficiently and well, but this is not efficiency of the machine, but an efficiency of well regulated home. The reason for this feeling at home is the staff, the people, and for us the foremost face of this warm hospitality has been the team manager, Dillah, who while highly professional, is also warm and kind person. In Dillahâs team, and we think, among all the staff there,  people like and respect each other and this somehow reflects on us and creates a very nice atmosphere for guests,too.",10,Aug-22,

However when I arrived at the hotel, the front desk went ahead to go through the whole check in process again as they said that they were not informed by my husband that he was expecting me.

PARKROYAL on Beach Road,"Parkroyal has been one of my favourite hotel in Singapore and this is my 3rd stay with Parkroyal at Beach rd. The hotel is clean, and the reason why we came back again is because of the big and spacious deep pool as we can enjoy our snorkeling gears.  There is also many good eateries around. It will be a perfect location for the tourists as the train station is just 5-10 mins away from the hotel, city center is 1 station away.  I stayed for 2 nights on this stay however this time round, I can see the lack of customer service during our check in and check out process. Requested for an hour late check out but wasn't allowed to do so. The concierge team was also seen as unfriendly.",8,Jul-22,
PARKROYAL on Beach Road,I enjoyed the gym and its proximity to the pool. Breakfast was good with lots of choice though western cooked breakfast was not as good quality as some hotels but good none the less. The coffee machines were in need of constant refill  but was attended to as well as could be expected but a third machine is needed to cope with demand. Good central location that is not  on too much of a busy road with subway very close by.,8,Aug-22,

So I need not worry about my toddler as much. 2nd time I have stayed in this hotel With 2 different rooms, & their rooms are big. 1 king bed, managed to get a cot in, and still have so much space to move abt. And air con is great. It doesn't stop in the middle of the night.  Hotel receptionists could be more friendlier, I feel? Their service level vs the concierge, were quite obvious. But no bad experiences, just a heads up. Felt that the shower area for the pool should be installed on both sides, cuz many guests who chose to sit on the left prior to entering, actually went down to the kids pool to wash themselves before heading in to the main one. In-room supplies - cotton buds & cotton pads are not available.â¦",8,Jul-21,

She even extended her help by guiding them to our table and also ask how was our dinner so far. It really does gives a touch of warmth and genuinity to our first experience to Ginger.

"PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, Singapore","Dreadful hotel - part way through some very, very noisy building works.
With noise levels like this it should not be open until the works are complete.
The reception is half blocked off with partitioning -this is acceptable but the noise on the 18th floor is horrific. They limit the building works from 0900hrs to 1800hrs but if you want to work in your room or sleep after 0900hrs you will find it very difficult. 
Having travelled from the UK I was jet-lagged and the only way I could get a rest was by playing music into my noise cancelling headphones. I was too tired to complain at the time and where would they have put me if that was the type of room they think is acceptable for guests.
The hotel is a bit worn at the edges but maybe it will be good once upgraded.  I can sleep through most things but it was like two hammer drills inside the room. I suspect they were immediately above. 
This review is to warn you about the amount of disruption and building works in the hotel and will not be valid after a few months. I stayed in November 2019.",2,16-Nov-19,

Hotel staff could not find our luggage in there own store after waiting till 5:30pm to get the room I had to go down stairs and get my own bags.

"PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, Singapore","The hotel should be ok for Smokers, but non-smokers, need to inhale the smoke smell in the lift, room corridor and the room has the smoke smell.  
It was told that 13th floor is smoking floor and it has an impact on the 14th floor, my room was changed to the 9th floor, but it had also the smoke smell which can be smelt on the clothes and got an air freshner my self as the staff  says that some guests stayed and smoked even though there is fine of $300.  Why can't smoke detectors kept at every non-smoking room and fine the smokers instantly.  

Room cleaning and breakfast is positive to note.  The room apart from smoking is ok to stay.

Hotel has guests who do not have courtesy or manners.  For example, when you try to come out from the lift they will come into lift without giving way for the guests in the lift to come out.  This has nothing to do with the Hotel management, but the guests are of that type.  This is only a sample and it could be seen on the breakfast also.

If you have problem with your room access card you have again to stand in line, if directed to other staff, he will tell that he is dealing with others and need to wait.  After room change, I had to come out of lift three times to tell the card does not work for the floor of the changed room.  Finally he changed to card itself.

Another staff, June will always say the hotel rules and would never listen to your request or make an effort to help you.

They were helpful and polite and called to check on your well being even though I had stayed here under a Quarantine Order.

Park Regis Singapore,"I would rate it 10 is the restaurant is open and we don't have to eat inside the room as it is not equipped with chairs and tables that can accommodate two persons. Last year even with the pandemic, we stayed with another hotel that already allowed dining in at the restaurant so not sure why even with easing of restrictions it is not implemented just yet.  On the customer service side the staff are very helpful with accommodating requests even if the hotel is undermanned. I am also grateful for the cupcake and card given for my birthday.   I didn't get to try other amenities, only the pool that while it is not too large there are only a few people using it so I had a good time swimming by myself. Too bad there is no mini-bars to serve drinks on request. Again, this is to compareâ¦",8,Mar-22,

You can also use their lounge at the lobby for work purposes. The staff were mostly ladies and they were all kind and very helpful. They assisted us with bags, opening doors, waiting for taxis, etc. We checked out at 11am and went outside.

Park Regis Singapore,"All in all, my stay in the hotel for a week was a pleasant experience. Staff were always available and willing to assist with even the tiniest requests.   The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is due to the minibar in the room not being a fridge. Even cranked up to the max setting, the minibar was barely cool, even the room's air conditioning was colder in comparison. Would suggest the hotel to look into replacing these with actual minibars that can keep drinks / food cold. ",8,Mar-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Park Regis is a great option, particularly for couples that hope to have a quiet, comfortable getaway but still having access to food options and other convinences of being at the city centre.  Within walking distance of Clarke Quay MRT, it is easy to be spoilt for food choices from hawkers in Chinatown to Restuarants are Robertson Quay.  Similar high praise would be given to the staff of Park Regis - the foundation of any worthy hospitality establishment. My wife and I were attended to by Charley and Yati, both of whom were familiar faces that facilitated out stay throughout.

Park Regis Singapore,"Most disgusting place to live in in Singapore. My sincere request to travellers to think 100 times before booking this hotel. There is no provision even for senior citizens for taking your luggage to your room.... you have to pull,drag your luggage first to the 3rd floor reception and then to your room. There is absolutely no ROOM Service. No House keeping...Room is not made up even after repeated requests. Most RUDE staff right from the Reception. Inspite of booking room with Buffet Breakfast they handed us packed breakfast on a small card board traywith tasteless stuff. On cancelling the breakfast they handed us over Singapore $ 10 per head to go have breakfast out side. ",2,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The staff was amazing. You really canât beat the location. You are by two train stations, and walking distance to tons of hawker centers and food. But the kicker for me, was the laundry. They have self laundry, which was a life saver for me since my stay was extended. My only issue was some maintenance issues around the hotel. Like some old tiles around the pool. Some of the grout lines in my bathroom was a bit dirty. Some of the gym equipment was a bit worn. ",8,Mar-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The stay was spoiled by the room cleanliness where it's expected to a daily housekeeping service, especially during this COVID period. A piece of rubbish was on the floor from the day I moved in and was still there 7 days later when I moved out. The tiled floor was not mopped, floormat and other complimentary coffee and tea was not provided and replenished each day.  However, the front staff at the restaurant, concierge and reception were very friendly and helpful.",4,Jul-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"A lovely looking hotel with pool, great for sleeping and recharging over night. We attempted to check in early, but were told there were no rooms available, even though we had requested and confirmed day use of a room via email. Checking out was a trial - 10am is a ridiculous time to have a fire alarm test. The lifts went out and then all the computers at office, very chaotic and frustrating!  The maid service was weird, they seemed to get to our room on the fourth floor (of seven) at 6pm when we were showering after our day, getting ready for dinner. As such we barely got the bed changed in our 8 day stay and only clean towels and toilet paper. The pool was lovely and refreshing but very heavily chlorinated, you couldn't stay in for too long. The buffet breakfast was extremelyâ¦",6,Jul-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"I stayed at the Park Regis for for 6 days during a trip to Singapore.  While the accommodations were comfortable and the location was decent (though the most used MRTs were 10+ min walk - hard in heat), I had a terrible time getting ahold of ANYONE at the front desk, housekeeping, etc.  I waited 20 minutes to check in, and it took 14 hours to get a clean coffee mug/cup.   In a pinch Iâd stay again, but the service definitely needs work.",6,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Thank you Park Regis, I had a lovely stay.  All staff were very friendly and polite. The location was very good, close to MRT and bus transport.

All in all I had a pleasant stay and recommend Park Regis as a great place to stay in SIngapore.",10,Jul-22,

Park Regis Singapore,Nice Hotel well located  near Clark Quay  Rooms are large  - we had a disability access room  so only problem is with a wet room - it does wet most of the bathroom area  - could do with a curtain around the shower area. Lovely Pool ,8,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Good   - location is convenient - pool is fabulous - restaurant service nothing to complain about  Bad  - Front desk needs to be trained on service.. absolutely terrible  - Customer service over all in Singapore is not great, so this hotel is no different. They don't understand customer delight  - seen cleaner hotels for the price you pay   Overall rate them at 6/10",6,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The man servicing the breakfast counter was rude and condescending. I reached earlier so was waiting to check-in and the person at the service desk asked me to get some breakfast while they were getting my room ready. When I went downstairs to get breakfast, the person servicing asked me what do you want to do here? I said ""Eat food!"" I was not welcomed not sure why, he was super rude.",8,Jul-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"What can I said, polite and friendly staff, clean room, confortable bed, good location near restaurants, convenience stores, subway station. Did not try the restaurant, gym or pool. Definitely #1 option when back to Singapore ",10,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Great location,  comfortable clean room, great vegetarian food in restaurant and reasonably priced.  Staff friendly.  Pool excellent but women's changing room unpleasant.  Bad smell, shower floods,  dirty. Also it's great to be abke to use pool if you have checked out and waiting for late flight, but access via reception level is awkward, should be an easier entry. ",8,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Service staff was friendly. The hotel even upgraded my room, and it had excellent views. Unfortunately the floors feel somewhat damp, there's a bit of mold on the shower wall, the shower stall door seal was loose so water seeped out, and there was a used mask on the floor near the guest elevators which wasn't cleared away fast enough (it was there when I checked in around 5pm and still there around 10am the following day.",6,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Nice stay. Hotel staffs (including the security) were very professional, courteous and exceptionally helpful. Room was very clean. I have enjoyed my stay with Park Regis amid a short stay. I would book with this hotel again in the near future. ",8,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,The Hotel is located Directly in clark quay and you are everywhere you want in a Shirt Time by feet or by metro. Nice rooms perfect service really really good. Can recommend this Hotel. Lovely Greets. ,10,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"We enjoyed the convenience of a great location. Public transport was very convenient. The advantage of many cafes and restaurants and the vibrant Riverside allure was a great pull. The room facilities could be improved to match the other conveniences the hotel provides. Bathroom position and facilities were not convenient and showers could be better. Bed linen was reasonable, but towels and bathrobes provided were of poor quality and one even threadbare! I hardly expected to see this in a 4 star property.  I must commend the staff who were always polite and helpful and made a special effort to be helpful at all times. The swimming pool was the high point as the operating  times were convenient. With some improvement of the points highlighted, this would be a great place to stay.",8,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Stayed for 7 nights.  Small but comfortable room.  Great location opposite metro station and Clarke Quay and 5 minutes walk from Chinatown.  Nice pool area and great location.  Free water bottles in lobby fantastic. ,8,May-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"No value to stay next time with this price. I stayed for 30 min to cool the room. When i call the reason, i found the out of date aircon. Staff did not know how to manage  a lot of waiting guests and took a long time to check in and out.",4,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I love the hotel in terms of convenience and the overall vibe around Park Regis. The staff were very friendly and accommodating as well as room cleaning service too!! I would be back one day when i visit Singapore again. Definitely a worth place putting nights off since its also easy access to Orchard, Bugis and central parts of Singapore!",10,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"So disappointed. First off they never replied to my email, then even with extra night paid for for early check in and comment made on booking they did not allocate our 2 rooms but listed us as no show. Only 1 person on reception. Took 20 minutes wait to check out 2 rooms then half an hour to process our check in. Staff was surly and arrogant. Room was dirty, beds messy, badly designed and tiny to boot. Standard single size bed only. Room was not dark as wardrobe light never went off. Air conditioner was complicated. Access to drawers, wardrobe, toilet difficult. My kids telephone didnt work. Room service was cold and not translated accurately as per menu. Pool water was cold even at 31 degrees.

Park Regis Singapore,"One night stop between Europe and New Zealand.  Check in was slow, but it was a holiday and the rooms were not available until 3.00. We were able to swim and wash and left our luggage and went sightseeing. Location is excellent. Ate at the local hawker market",8,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,I do not know how this hotel is 4 stars. Rooms are not clean. Our sink was clogged and the bathroom/shower smelled rancid. Some towels were ripped up. Check-in process took 30 minutes and at check out no one even bothered to ask how our stay was. Location is good but there are plenty of nice hotels in the area - go somewhere else.,2,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Was travelling with my family. Room rate is acceptable. Room is clean. For location wise, itâs very convenient, very short distance walk to food market, shopping area, and also 7-11.  The concierge is very friendly and helpful.  Overall, itâs a great stay!",8,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Have stayed there lots of times. First time back since COVID. Unfortunately things are significantly worse. The room had a bunch of poor maintenance that gave it a down at heel feel. The breakfast which was ok previously was really poor now, I've had better breakfasts in budget hotels. Really disappointing. The pool which is a decent size to swim in was not cleaned daily as there was rubbish at the bottom of the pool for several days. The advertised direct price doesn't include taxes so you might aswell use booking.com etc Checkin somehow takes forever. Shame because the location is convenient and the rooms are quiet.",4,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The only good point about this hotel is the location & how close it is to the metro. Unfortunately thatâs the only positive.   The standard Queen room has an open plan bathroom/ toilet. It is not separate. Something which was not so clear to us when we booked. Very very small room, shower & toilet are in glass cubes on the side of the bed. Honestly the worst.   The overall cleanliness was very poor.   I did raise my concerns to the manager called Audrey, she did not show any interest. By far the worst customer service I have ever received.    Please be careful before booking this hotel.",2,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The room was cozy, the bed felt as if weâre sleeping on clouds, and the customer service was exceptional. Overall, we had a great experience for our home away from home even if itâs just for a couple of days. ",10,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Staff were super friendly, rooms were clean, location is extremely convenient as MRT station is just opposite the hotel. Walking distance to Fort Canning Park, and nearest shopping malls such as the Central, Funan, etc. Only one train station away from Dhoby Ghaut, and three stations away from Vivo City. Such convenience!",10,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Refrigerator was out of order.  There was no kettles.  I could not have no coffee, no tea, or ice in the room,  I never faced such situation before.  If the hotel needs to charge more to put working refrigerator and kettle, the hotel should charge sufficient amount.",4,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Great location. Accessibility to tourist attractions is very easy, you can walk safely or take the metro rail. The very friendly staff made our stay very comfortable. Perhaps a greater choice of eggs i.e. scrambled.",8,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Rooms need a fresher look.  cleanliness of the rooms are questionable.  Our toilet area smelt all the time we were there.  the sink needed a good scrub.  Rooms weren't cleaned on a daily basis. One day we let the reception know we were going to be away all day and requested the room to be cleaned and bed linen changed.   When we returned  late afternoon, nothing had been done in the room.  After ringing Reception, a cleaner did arrive soon after.  Regarding your restaurant, staff were friendly however the food was not hot and in my opinion, not worth the cost.  High praise to your concierge staff who were friendly and helpful at all times. ",6,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Check in and out was fast. Great location. Breakfast was adequate and nice. Staff at breakfast helped my mum when they saw her use a walking stick. Pool was good, but not easy to get into, for elderly with weak knees. There are only ladders, no steps. Mattress was a tad too soft, otherwise, the room layout was compact and well laid out and has everything needed. I booked a room with direct pool access, which was nice. Only problem during the stay was that the air con broke down towards morning and was down the whole morning. Tried to call at 7+ but there was no answer. Only managed to contact housekeeping closer to 8am. I was checking out that day, so it was not too big a deal. ",8,Jun-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Please refer to my previous comments on food and bar services. The breakfast was poor and after travelling for two months probably the lowest standard we experienced. There was no comfortable lounge bar, bar food or small meal offerings, the restaurant menu was over priced and too complex. We have travelled throughout Asia, including Singapore, and Europe and were surprised at the poor quality of these services. We did like the room and the Concierge and Reception support was excellent.",6,Jun-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Fantastic location very close to Clarke quay MRT. The property is decent, our room had a leakage issue and the lights weren't working properly. Housekeeping was poor and the staff was indifferent. They charge a 200SGD refundable deposit which we found odd. Overall pick this property for decent pricing and a great location ",6,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Okay accommodation but poor room service and breakfast was terrible. The location was good and close to most attractions. Pool was good but the gym was quite small The staff were pleasant except for the restaurant were service quality was poor,6,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I stayed here a lot before COVID and happy to see that after 2.5 years away from Singapore, the hotel has added extra self serve laundry service at the basement. it's a huge benefit for me as I travel a lot and laundry is one of the factors to consider when I choose a hotel.  In general, the hotel is good, clean and bright. The housekeeping crew is very accommodating with my small requests. The only problem I have with this hotel is the smell of drainage in the shower room and toilet, the smell was not as strong during my stay last week, however, it's quite strong when I returned to stay at the hotel (in a different room) this time.  Breakfast choices are improved this week but not a lot of healthy options for cereals. There are always not enough staff at the reception,â¦",8,Jun-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Nice hotel, great location, friendly hoteliers definitely a place to stay for the next visit be it with family, friends or business trip. Would prefer a wider choice of breakfast menu that would be perfect ",10,Jun-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"It's a cozy enough room for 2, 3 would be a crowd. Grateful for the concierge to help me change into a two single beds instead of a queen bed room. They had nice service as well and were nice throughout my whole stay there.",10,Mar-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Fantastic location. Reception and concierge staff were fantastic and very helpful. Dining staff weren't as helpful and on multiple occasions were bordering on being rude as they were pushy and didn't feel like I was welcome there.,8,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"If you mostly just use your hotel to sleep (like I do) itâs a good hotel. The beds are very comfortable. Most of my time is spent enjoying the city, not sitting in a hotel. There is a river across the street with an incredible number of restaurants to choose from. A highly recommend walk.   The downside of this hotel is that there are no electronic plugs beside the bed. And the Wi-Fi is so slow itâs basically useless. The TV volume levels are purposely limited to keep noise down. So low you canât really hear the TV unless you are sitting right in front of it.   But if you can go along with those shortcomings, itâs a fine choice.  ",8,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"overall stay is ok, strategic location which the nearest MRT clark quay station just 5 min walk. and nearby is chinatown point and MRT station, which is very convenience for shop and for food, near to hong lim food centre as well if you are looking for local food stall, which is famous as well.",6,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Due to renovation gym and dining room were closed. There fore I got a disppointing breakfast in the room. I was not informes about the closed gym and dining room before my stay otherwise I would have taken another hotel. I stayed for 4 nights and the room was not cleaned even once due to Covid. At least every 2nd day I expected the cleaning stuff tho change towels and clean up the room. ,4,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I love the convenience of the location, having it close to Clarke Quay and China town i.e. it's easy to find food even in the middle of the night. The direct booking with hotel under the 'Gin & Tint' package was nice, and there was complimentary breakfast too. Breakfast was delivered to room as bento set, no selection given but it's complimentary so nothing to complain though a small suggestion is to replace those packet soft drinks with coffee or tea or juice. ",8,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,The hotel is perfectly located with great restaurants ( Clark Quay) and many food courts and hawker centers in Chinatown. Nice Park Fort Canning to go jogging. The help is very nice and helpful and find solution for every request. Be aware : due to covid they only clean the room every 2 or 3 day. In my case room was not cleaned during 4 days long :( Breakfast : average â> prefer to go out and find coffee and toast nearby,8,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Even I had claimed several times, breakfast has lot of room for improvement. No fruits, no cereals, no fresh juice. Even we have the Covid situation other hotels had a much better solution. The team, was excellent and always willing to ease my stay and help,where ever it's possible. The location nice and close to the park quay. In case of rain it was easy to hear the noise from the roof. This disturbed the sleep.",8,Mar-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The staff were fantastic and they clearly had some challenging customers during my staff which they handled professionally and with ease.   It is a nice, clean and friendly stay with no great complaints and it is good to see the restaurant renovations start to keep this hotel fresh. While I had some minor complaints it would not stop me from staying here again and the staff really made the difference to the positive.  Park Regis is located in an ideal area for those wanting to explore the clarke & boat quay areas while being close to the shopping district",6,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The hotel is currently offering only a plastic tray with breakfast delivered to the relatively small rooms. There are refurbishment works going on, restaurants are closed. Due to Corona the fan of the air condition could not be lowered, so that there was considerable noise also during the night. Cleaning of the room has to be asked for and does not always take place even then. The pool was open but has seen better times, the pool towels are in such a condition, that I as a hotel manager would be embarassed to offer them to guest. Currently not to be recommended.",2,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Not acceptable for a room category of this price and performance class. The implementation of service quality leaves a lot to be desired,  Good walking distance to public transport, restaurant and bars. ",2,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The hotel's location is really what makes it good with it's proximity to the Blue Line (China Town Station), and the Clark Quay area but I wouldn't go so far as saying that it's 4 star hotel, more 3. They were in the middle of renovations of the common areas so except for the pool there was nothing else open. What I really hope they renovate though are the rooms. They are old, the carpets look like they're still trying to cling onto the 1960s, the tv in my room wasn't working, the fridge also was barely hanging on, the mugs were dirty so I didn't bother using them. There was also one plug in the main room and then another one in the bathroom, so really limited for the million devices we all need to charge.  I would also recommend staying away from the 516-520 rooms, that seemedâ¦",6,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Great location. Staff is very welcoming. the bathroom is abolutely tiny and not fully enclosed so everytime its used the room stinks up. The ACs are also under powered for summer. Takes a while to cool down the room so everytime you are out you dread going back to the stuffy room,4,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Great location. Beautiful swimming pool. Excellent services at the front desk. They allowed us to check in early. For some reason, they didn't clean the room during the whole stay.   Nevertheless, overall it was great value for money.  I would give 5 stars if the room was cleaned every day. ",8,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"There are currently no food and beverage outlets open in the hotel due to renovations, this was not made clear during to booking process. The fridge (mini bar as they called it) did not keep anything cold and was a waste of space. The staff suggested I use ice so I ordered some at a cost (it was not free as normal in a hotel) but half way through my stay the hotel ran out of ice and they did not get anymore. There was never any pool towels, I was told I would have to wait an hour as there were no clean towels in the hotel. The room was nice, bed was good and staff were friendly.",4,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Location very good, near Chinatown and nearby MRT with direct line to Farrer Park Hospital (3stops away) and only one stop away from Dhoby Ghaut, to shopping centres. Walking distance to Clarke Quay Capital Mall, and enjoyed restaurants along riverside with live and music nightlife.  Staff courteous and helpful always. Cleaning of rooms should be done on daily basis, instead of upon request daily. ",8,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Amazing area, right in the city centre but it's overpriced with minimum services. The breakfast was terrible and on the first day they didn't have vegetarian options at all. Had to ask the staff to not send it. The housekeeping was done every 3 days.",4,Apr-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Conveniently located opposite Clarke Quay and the MRT station. Excessive and unnecessary covid protocols- no room cleaning until the 3rd day, no restaurant open, pool under renovation and gym equipment out of order.. very small rooms ideal for 1 person. Washrooms arenât ventilated at all and no separation between the toilet and the bedroom. Very cramped room design too..",6,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Front desk staff are helpful and friendly. Housekeeping can be improved. My room was not cleaned despite reminders. Towels are old and amenities limited. The room key cards didn't work and I had to change cards three times.,6,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Overall ok, room felt a little cramped and I can't complain because of the value for money. Breakfast wasn't that great so next time I would rather not include breakfast with the room. There was a day when the room wasn't made up so I was surprised why. Also the door doesn't auto close fully by itself. ",6,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"When reading comments from others, I fell I was not in the same hotel... Or maybe the management and staff have recently changed (I was there on 5&6 April 2022), because it was one of my worse experience for business trip.  Negative The restaurant for breakfast was not available (but never mentionned while booking), and the hotel was proposing some in-room breakfast. When I woke up, I tried to call the reception, the restaurant and the room service to get my breakfast, and I was unable to reach anybody. I had to go in the lobby to ask for my breakfast.

Park Regis Singapore,"The Service staff are generally friendly, Warm and welcoming.  I m aware the Hotel is going through a revamp however that does not stop the staff to provide service with a smile.

Park Regis Singapore,Average room - basic amenities- compact is an understatement & disappointing average customer service. Called front desk for assistance & never heard back from them. Just one of those places you stay but never remember. Central location to food & transport was good.,6,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Check in was done in less than 10mins.  Polite check in staff & fuss free. Room is average small but comfortable & clean. Really appreciated that they had the Kiblat direction located in the room. Close the curtains if you're not an early riser as the sun is pretty strong in the morning. Check out was super fast & easy.  3 mins walking distance to mosque too.  Down point, not many halal food places in walking distance.  For that, there is always grabfood or foodpanda. ",8,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The hotel is well located but fall short on basics for its price and category, starting for the airplane box breakfast you can only have in your room or the fact that they dont clean rooms everyday, things that you only find out when you arrive. There is no lobby or common areas apart from the small pool.",2,Apr-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The location was great! It was right in front of Clarke Quay, and in between Clarke Quay MRT and Chinatown. The toliet and the shower room was separated, which was great. However, I still wonder why there were no housekeeping during our whole stay. We always had to ask for towel change.",8,May-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I got to the hotel. It wasn't high end, sort of middle / nothing... but it was expensive for what it was. I had a room with a noise that kept me up much of the night, so I had to change room. That was ok. My room was ok, but cost different amounts for either night, because of ""dynamic pricing"". I asked for a discount given I couldn't sleep with the room noise and they gave me a cab charge. I wouldn't go back ever again and would recommend against it.",2,May-22,

Those driving, car park fee is complimentary - do check for availability. Room is at smaller size, however, met expectation and value for money.

Our room had rubbish left in drawers, no tea or coffee and the towels were thread bare and grey, the bath mat even had a 10cm tear across it. We stayed 5 nights and only had the room serviced once when we asked for it as we had run out of toiletries, tea and coffee and the towels would not dry.

For evening dining and entertainment, Clarke Quay is the most happening place. Lots of bars, restaurants and cafes alongside the river. You can also take a cruise on the river.

Park Regis Singapore,"After reading the previous reviews I was a bit hesitant to book us here but what a wonderful surprise. The room was clean albeit a bit small, we had plenty of towels and the check in and check out was really fast.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Stayed for 6 nights while on holiday. We booked a room next to the pool for easy access.  The location is perfect , 5 minutes walk to Clark Quay for lively bars and restaurants. The staff and surroundings were very good. The room was cleaned daily , only point is that the rooms next to pool are quite small if you have luggage for two people for a week. Would definitely recommend.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I look forward to my next visit to Singapore.  Park Regis will be my hotel of choice.  It is in a great location, the rooms are very clean and customer service exceeded my expectations.  I enjoyed the breakfast as well.  ",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"This trendy boutique hotel is conveniently situated between Clark Quay & Chinatown.  Across the road from the subway, it's easy & cheap to get to all parts of Singapore.  100m from the heart of Clark Quay in one direction & 100m in the opposite direction you're in Chinatown.  Close to restaurants, bars & shopping. The rooms are small but our queen-size bed was very comfortable.  We had a comfortable bay window overlooking the pool.  The bathroom lacked a little privacy considering the walls & doors were frosted glass.  However, the shower was excellent.  It was a very cosy room & was well appointed.   The gym & pool facilities were small but excellent.   Because this room was a little on the small size I think it would best suit the business traveller.  However, as a couple, weâ¦",8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Excellent option for a one-night stay, very quiet and peaceful sleep in the heart of town. The swimming pool definitely gets my vote! Rates offered were definitely interesting. Only the breakfast option was not clear when I checked in but reception gave me the information.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The location was perfect. right in front of the hotel, there is Clarke quay, subway station, shopping mall(clarke quay central etc.) The hotel employees were perfectly kind and the price was affordable. But room condition was normal. There is no separated restroom, so I can hear my family's shower sound and pooping. The wallpaper in the room was a little dirty, because there were stains. It was good overall.",6,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Had a great stay with Park Regis. Rooms were clean, convenient location and great staff.   Special shout-out to Tim who is super friendly and assisted with all my queries despite being so busy. :)   Will be back again",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The room size is suit for short trip to SG and the service is good. Quick response after I called the helpdesk for no water supply issue, and it's resumed after 15 mins. Location is ok, 5 mins walk to restuarants (e.g. Jumbo Seafoods) and 10~15 mins walk to China Town.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Very convenient and close to most sights. Although our room didn't have views but we were close enough to the ground to have bamboo tree forming a lovely frame around our window which made it feel more like a tropical getaway. ,8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,I stayed for a while and it felt like coming home after a long day in the office. I took the chance to relax and do some sports in the gymn or in the pool. With the MRT station close by even rain was no issue to get to work. Plenty of shopping and food possibilities are colse by. ,10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Great location, close to Clark Quay and China Town. Thd rooms were very clean. The staff were very friendly, breakfast was very good, great choice.  Rooms were on the small side if you were staying longer than a few days but that's just personal choice.",8,Aug-22,

Park Regis Singapore,For an aged married couple the hotel. Was perfect on lots of fronts.The bathroom is rather open and some people would find it not private enough.Location is perfect for  MRT and Clarke and Boat quay eating and drinking.Found a good price special if staying 5 nights or more.,10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The room was clean and cozy, but have to improve on breakfast buffet because the spread is not big enough and some of the dishes are not that good. Swimming pool is clean and the view is nice from above. The staff were OK there.",8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I usually use a different hotel, but it was full and I couldn't book it, so I chose this hotel this time.  This hotel is modern, but I am disappointed that the rooms are small. I was also disappointed because the light bulb in the shower room was out. (but i used it)  The station is close and convenient. The staff on the 1st floor arranged a taxi early in the morning.  I couldn't cancel the credit card deposit due to bank reasons, but Mr.Ryan sent me an email later that the procedure was completed. We appreciate.",8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The hotel staff and team were very efficient, friendly and very helpful. Right from the duty manager to the reception to the floor crew were never short of excellence and it felt very calming and comfortable being isolated and even conducted weekly games via zoom to keep our sanity. I'll give five star to the room facilities and excellent service and support. Plus I love the routine custom cards given for every meal, it's really thoughtful!",10,Jun-21,
Park Regis Singapore,"For the price, itâs a 3/10 Hotel. Very disjointed. Zero bar scene. The breakfast was poor. Hotel pool is ok. The greeting staff are security only. Not very knowledgeable of the area. Avoid if you can.",4,Aug-22,

Breakfast menu needs to be improved         Rooms are spacious.  Staff is polite . Overall good stay",8,Jul-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I stayed with Park Regis Singapore for two one night stays, at both ends of business travel to Malaysia.   Check in was a little slow, but that's to be expected with COVID related staffing shortages. The pool looked lovely from the view from reception but I didn't get a chance to visit.   Room was a little tired, but the bed was comfy. The location is great and I walked everywhere. Check out was super quick and an easy drive to the airport.   If you're planning on spending lots of time at the hotel I wouldn't recommend, but if you're looking for a place to simply sleep whilst you're explore Singapore I think it's a good option.",8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Had a wonderful break. Lovely accommodation, immaculately clean and location about spot on. The staff where very helpful and friendly and the food was excellent. Will definitely put it on the to return to list.  ",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Standard hotel, looks better online than in real life. Itâs rather tired and old. Great location, good shower / aircon / wifi. Staff were friendly. A few minutes walk to Clarke quay MRT, close to lots of great Gawler de tres, at the right price itâs worth staying here.",6,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Park Regis is a great location. You can walk to many tourist attractions, shopping malls and the markets. It has beautiful surroundings and all the facilities needed. The friendly, helpful staff and service you receive make for a wonderful stay. Highly recommend.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Location and neatness of the hotel is good with well-appointed rooms. However, the staff is terrible, don't have any courtesy or hospitality in their behaviour. You are rudely asked to take your own luggage to the room, the reception staff is unfriendly and they are quite unhelpful and curt in general. Wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, with the staff's deplorable attitude being the only reason. ",2,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,The location is good. Next to China town and 25 minutes walk to Merrion water fountain. Reasonably priced. Only issue was the whole night water from air conditioner was dripping into the bathroom making loud nosie disturbed the sleep throughout the stay.,8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"It was very good during our stay. The hotel was clean and close to the city, so transportation was convenient and the location was very good. Staff service was very good. I want to visit again next time I go to Singapore.",10,Aug-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Overall stay was decent, but the room was too hot. The room temperature was set to 19 degrees and the lowest temperature allowed was 16 degrees but for some reason it kept resetting itself to 19 degrees. I was waking up several times during the night sweating.",6,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Booked 2 single bed but given 1 master bed. Room window facing mosque, front desk shall ask whether i am ok Wash basin and shower drainage suspect some minor clog Breakfast are good with variety choices ",6,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Great location - easy walk to Chinatown, and just opposite Clarke Quay (shops/restaurants/river cruises) and MRT station.  Housekeeping, breakfast and concierge staff were wonderful - friendly, efficient and super helpful. Reception staff on the other hand were very cold, unhelpful and seemed to be displeased to be disturbed from their computers for check in/check out!  The rooms are well equipped and bed comfortable. It is an open plan bathroom/bedroom which might not be ideal for some, but fine as a solo traveller.  The air con is very weak and could do with being upgraded.  Pool is very nice as is gym.  ",8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Service at the hotel was excellent. Arrived early at the hotel and checking in was no problem. Bed was super comfy. Room was clean and everything worked perfectly. Got to freshen up after checking out using pool towels which was nice. The pool itself is pretty good as well. All in all would recommend.,10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"One or 2 Indian vegetable itens can be added in the breakfast menu to attract for global clients. Also change the overall daily menu as during our stay of 6 days, all the items were repeated. Hash brown in particular was very hard to eat.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Booked this hotel for. 3 night family holiday. In terms of location it was brilliant. MRT across road and walkable to Clarke Q and China Town. A little slow in terms of checking in and we declined the breakfast option as I thought it was over priced. But over all an enjoyable stay and would stay here again ,8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The room 422 smell very, very bad. The carpet is not clean and smell like a if someone throws up. Finally the staff change our room and the new room was amazing. The breakfast was nice and the staff very kind",8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Overall I am satisfied with staying here and willing to take it again. Especially the location is perfect near the office area for the business and also close from marina bay for the sightseeing. To the airport it also takes just 20 minutes. However the room is quite small for two people and the shower booth is quite old.,8,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Good location in Singapore next to Clarke Quay MRT and Chinatown.   We asked for a twin room and got a king bed but apart from that good stay.   The room price is very expensive for what we got but book direct and you get breakfast included which was great.,8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Nice location and very friendly front desk personnel. It's near the MRT and bust stops.  However, when I check my bed, I saw a hair underneath the sheets. It looks like they did not change the beddings. :(",6,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Clean and quiet. Great location to shops and restaurants. Excellent seafood restaurant in the hotel. Very close to river and boat cruise  Friendly staff. 25 SG$ taxi fare from Airport 10 min walk to Chinatown and MRT Clarke Quay just across the street,10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Easy to reach everything from the hotel - clean and comfortable . However I had a room in the 3rd floor (bit dark and directly over the pool) only - reception did not even look in a higher floor . Stuff was friendly - only the guys at the concierge was bit rough and need a smile next time . ,8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Fantastic stay! Room had everything you need. It is compact but you don't miss out on anything. Wonderful, kind and helpful staff and such a brilliant location for exploring around Singapore. Highly recommended",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,The hotel was good and comfortable. I would recommend:  ... A tea/coffee station is provided 24 hours in the lobby or on the 3rd floor at reception. ... Cleaning staff are trained to keep the supplies in the room at the state they are on arrival ,8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The only real issue I had was that there was no hand soap, so I had to use shower gel to wash my hands in the washbasin. I called housekeeping to ask for that, but did not get any. Nor did I get new shampoo/shower gel when I ran out. Again, I called housekeeping, but to no avail, so I got some from the cart when I saw the cleaner on my floor.",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"If youâre looking for a comfortable, reasonably priced and well located hotel for a short stay in Singapore, the Park Regis is a good option. The front of house staff were friendly and professional, check in was efficient. We organised a late checkout the next day for an extra fee, and this was definitely a good move with time to rest and recharge before our final flight home. The decor in the rooms is a little tired looking and could probably benefit from a refurb in the next few years, but the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in, and the water pressure in the shower was excellent. Clarke Quay is just a couple of minutes walk away, Boat Quay around a further 5-10 minutes away, as is Chinatown. I canât comment on the restaurants or room service options, butâ¦",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Well located for the waterfront and Chinatown. Staff very helpful, rooms are on the small side but well appointed with the basics. Very quiet, swimming pool was nice a little dated but great to have on a hot day. ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Excellent stay with beautiful room. Reception was very kind and considerate to offer us early checkin and allocate room though we were 5 hours early. Excellent location. In walking distance to China Town and Little India. Lots of restaurants with multi National Cusine.,10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Very Good clean good food and nice bed thanks staff all good with taxis and baggage very good thanks would go back to Regis park no worries thanks, we could leave our baggage there when we arrived and we could left it there a departure awesome",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"No doubt, I had a Had a wonderful stay with Park Regis Singapore. I would like to see more vegetarian menu in the breakfast dinner and room service. The rooms were well clean and well maintained. Optimally located near to CBD and offices.   ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I was embarrassed because the top of the bathroom was open. Other than that, the rest was very good. The traffic was good, too. There was both a subway station and a bus stop 5 minutes away and it was very close to Chinatown.",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"On a global standard the accommodation doesnât provide best value, however Singapore accommodation is extremely expensive so by that standard the accommodation was good. Great location with a short walk to Clarke Quay and Chinatown. Room is small and bathroom does not offer much privacy. Room was clean and serviced daily. Check in and out was quick and easy. Parts of the hotel were closed for maintenance so couldnât use all facilities.",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Very good location,  near to Clarke quay mrt. Hotel staff are friendly. The swimming pool better than I thought. There's a tung lok restaurant right at the hotel lobby. Great idea for dinner gathering.",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"All staff are really nice and very helpful. The location is also good and near to the city centre. I like the facilites like swimming pool and gym room, it made me have better slepping quality at night after some sports.",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Everything was fine, was able to check in early so we were able to take a rest when we came in. We havenât eat breakfast on our last day cause we had to leave the hotel by 6am and their breakfast was at 6:30am. But everything was a great!! Will definitely go back!",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Very helpful professional staff at reception. Arrived very early made actively worked to get us into a room early. Room was a good size and layout. For a 3 or 4 night stay room was very good, bed was comfortable and there was tea and coffee making facilities. And Clark Central and Quay are close for food etc",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,The Park Regis is very conveniently located close to MRT stations and Chinatown. The room was clean and the staff were very helpful. We had a problem with the wardrobe light not switching off and as soon as we reported it to staff the issue was quickly rectified. It was very helpful that we could use facilities such as the pool and gym after we checked out at 11 as we did not fly out until the evening.We would definitely choose to stay there on any future visits to Singapore.  On our last day staying there we discovered that there was agreat food centre located quite nearby.,10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Location was very good, near Chinatown, Clarke Quay and the MRT (100m from front door) all walking distance.  Room on the small side, open plan bathroom (no separating walls from rest of room) did not work for us, space was just too small and seemed cramped. Breakfast hot food variety each day was good, pastries were hit and miss on freshness each day, fruit selection was the same each day, Watermelon, Honey Dew and Dragon Fruit.   Air conditioner seemed to struggle to keep the room cool, set at 18 degrees and just kept it pleasant.  Did not use the pool or gym but both looked nice.   The Japanese restaurant in the hotel was very nice, had one meal there would recommend it.  Staff overall were friendly, depending who was on the concierge desk depended on the service you received, it varied greatly. Room cleaning: even with the ""please clean my room"" light on it could be late in the day before your room was cleaned, this was disappointing to be out all day then find your room still not cleaned. Reception on third floor: a sign by the lifts to tell you this, no meeter and greeter at the door, when we arrived at about 7pm only a dis-interested person at the concierge desk.  In general, the location was what we were after and were not disappointed, the hotel was okay.â¦",10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Hotel is a solid hotel operator with good swimming pool, gym and dining facilities. Rooms are very small but in reasonable condition. All staff very polite and helpful. If booking via Agoda, be extremely careful as Agoda have charged me $200+ more than they stated they would in our agreement and neither the hotel nor Agoda are willing to deal with it. Agoda in particular are extremely dishonest and disreputable in the way they are conducting pricing at this hotel in my opinion. Be very careful with using Agoda. Its a rip off ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Very nice and Clean Hotel, located near Clark Quey MTR station, staff is very polite. However the breakfast needs to be with more options. Overall very good experience staying.definitely recommend for staying ",10,Oct-22,

Park Regis Singapore,This hotel was in a great location to explore Singapore. They were very helpful at check in letting us in to our room early due to the nature of our flight. Our room was compact. But good and we could walk out to the pool. Breakfast was on till 10:30am which was a bonus too.  The only down side was the very rude gentleman called Tim at check out. Which ruined our whole experience. He needs to learn how to speak to customers lucky for him my wife was there.,6,Sep-22,

Park Regis Singapore,Very good location. The room is quite small. Housekeeping is good. Clean rooms. Front officer is very approachable. Had a Restaurant (Tunglok Seafood) that can be dine for a good lunch or dinner. Food their is great. ,8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Stayed at Regis for 8 nights  Rooms are small but functional  Bed is extremely comfortable and the room was quiet and dark for sleeping  Breakfast was excellent  Pool great but no access to drinks or snacks  Rooms cleaned daily and plenty of water supplied  Unsure what the concierge role was as they did not assist incoming guests and often did not greet you. We held the door often for guests with luggage as we came and went  Hotel is in an excellent position for seeing everything with easy access to restaurants and the amazing train service. ,8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"nice staff, I like the close proximity to clark quay, chinatown and the city centre with its business districts. Singapore Metro also close by to access all parts of the city easyl.Rooms are small but sufficiant. I also like the pool. only shortfall is that you won't get a taxi easily at that hotel if you need one urgently ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The bed was very comfortable and very easy for a long sleep-in. I am less than impressed with modern hotel room layouts like this, where the wash basin is in the main room space and it has separate cubicles for toilet and shower. Moving from toilet into main room then to shower then back to main room to dry is not a smooth nor pleasing experience. A designer must have thought it clever without actually running through the experience for several days. This is the only reason I give a poorer review. The room type may suit other people. ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,I've stayed in few hotels in Singapore.Park Regis is definitely one of the best hotels to stay. It's clean and peaceful; great amenities and most importantly the friendly and welcoming staffs. Location is very central with public transport within few minutes away on foot. Rooms may not be huge but it's ambience and designs are beyond expectation. My family love the hotel and definitely we'll be back in the near future. ,10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"The park regis is located so close to clarke quay and boat quay for restaurants  and night life.  Very close to both clarke quay and Chinatown mrt stations,  which we found the was the best way to get around.  Good breakfast available  each morning,  with friendly staff.  Lovely pool to take a dip after a full day of exploring.  We were on the 7th floor so had a great view of clarke quay and canning Park.  Rooms compact but had everything we needed,  and we're very comfortable.  Would definately recommend  to others.   ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,One of the advantages is the location.  There are many pubs and restaurants in Clarke Quay. You can enjoy Clarke Quay till late night if you want. It also close to MRT station so you can save your time to move around.,10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Good and comfortable room Nice breakfast buffet with egg station Fair pool Yes it is on a busy road but soundproofing is good and not more disturbing than an A/C background noise. Tends to work with large groups/families that are noiser than the road traffic. The so called city view rooms with ""picturesque views of Clarke Quay"" are actually views of the back of buildings of Clarke Quay.",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,Small room  which was quite tired and unhelpful  and unfriendly staff until last day. No information or maps available.Not very good value for money plenty of better value hotels near by. Even though it had nice pool would not stay here again or recommend.,6,Sep-22,

Park Regis Singapore,"Nice hotel and staff, good location, rooms are small though for twin share and thereâs no wall between bathroom and beds (just a curtain) so a bit weird if youâre sharing with a friend not a partner. Breakfast was good.",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,The internet quality was poor to support my work during my time at the Hotel. Room layout was weird with a sink in the middle of the room resulting in difficulties to access the wardrobe. I had requested an early checkin as I was coming from South America (fully registered via email) when I arrived there was no room available resulting in the need of upgrading the room to get one that was ready. Total additional cost of SD 120.,6,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I have stayed here on previous occasions and had enjoyable stays with good service. This last stay did not meet those standards. On arrival around midnight, we found that the twin beds that had been requested over a month previously were made together into a King size with a single quilt. As I was travelling with my adult son, this was not appropriate. The front desk receptionist worked hard to rectify the situation, providing an extra room on the same floor for one of us for the night with the beds in the original room to be separated the next day. This meant that one of us could not settle in as we had to move out of the room the next morning before 11 but at least we could keep one room.  The beds were separated the next day however the housekeeping staff did not see fit toâ¦",4,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"I had a good time. But 2 comments: 1) on my arrival, there was 1 of the 2 water bottles which was not sealed and already used. 2) During 2 days, I had no more shower gel and I needed to go the counter desk to ask for it. ",8,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,This hotel is in a great location to either walk to various parts of the city or jump on the MRT to travel the city. It is clean with nice staff and good service. Also enjoyed the breakfast. Would certainly recommend this hotel to others.,10,Sep-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Great pool, good gym and stylish rooms. But mind the (very) open bathroom, which is not seperated from the room. I liked it as a solo traveler, but I would chose another hotel if I travel with a friend.",10,Aug-22,
Park Regis Singapore,"Very small room, hardly enough space for  2 people and luggage. The shower is poor both in terms of design and use ability. It is in a small cabin along  with the toilet so the toilet gets wet.  Next person using toilet will get wet feet. Water temperature hard to control. It is convenient for the MRT and Chinatown. Didn't bother with breakfast - looked like a poor selection and way over-priced so walked to Chinatown. Staff friendly and helpful.

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Centrally located. Big rooms. The  view is not fantastic as it overlooks sombody else balcony.  Sufficient toiletries provided. Have read on internet that nespesso coffee appliance in room but that is not so. Make sure to ask during check in and ensure you get what you expect. Layout of room is good. Bathroom is small and the bath glass door opens up the wrong way should be outward instead of inwards which makes it difficult if you a a rather large stature   These are a few minor setback that need improving otherwise good hotel to stay.,8,2-Feb-20,

It's a overcrowded hotel and when we wanted to extend our stay, price was abnormally high, even higher than Shangri LA which is a way above level of this hotel.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"The Shangri-La Singapore has excellent facilities, possibly the best among any hotel in Singapore. Itâs not just the usual pool, gym and spa. This place packs a kidsâ club, water park, and tennis courts. Thereâs something for everyone.  We had a magnificent and memorable stay at the Valley Wing. Service provided by Keith, Edward, Sharmila, Florence and others was impeccable.  ",10,Jan-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"This was my first staycation at Shangri-La Singapore and it didn't disappoint. Check-in and check-out were smooth. The service staff were very welcoming, pleasant and professional. Our room was spacious and clean, and they also provided a care pack (masks, hand sanitiser and wet wipes) which was a nice touch. The breakfast at The Line restaurant was good, although the selection/variety of food can be more. Overall, it was a very comfortable and relaxed stay for us and we can't wait to come back again.",10,Jan-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),Chef Ganesan shared with us how he came out with each dishes and how he prepared them. I forgot the service staff name but he was very attentive too. The ambiance is very charming. The only thing that I hope they can improve is to put a signage to block the entrance from other guests. We were âvisitedâ by a couple of children and families.,10,Jan-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Not a very pleasant experience for adults. There are a lot of things to do for kids so if you do go it would mainly just be for them. The service is below average, our room smelled so bad (mainly of mildew) and the whole stay was just below average. My SIL and BIL also went there the week after I did and they had the exact same thoughts about the room and service. Just going once to experience the kids activities is enough. Wonât be going back there at all.",6,Mar-21,

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"There were so many things wrong with our staycation at the Shangri-la:  ð: We were greeted with hostility at the entrance.   ð§: During check-in, there was a long queue at 3pm. The staff allowed the family behind my friend who had come a little later than me to cut the queue by guiding them to the next available counter although she had arrived before them. Overall the check-in was slow (she ended up checking in at 4pm and arrived at the room a little later.)  ð±: I was greeted by a 1st strand of hair upon entering the room.

Housekeeping - kudo to the housekeeping lady, the room was cleaned and tidied immaculately everyday with coffee pods replenished without fail.  3.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Hosted breakfast at Lobby Lounge as a non-staying GC guest. The spread and quality of food was good, with a minor gripe being that the bread basket off the set wasnât as much a basket as it was single serving. Nonetheless the service was warm and friendly, and the location and environment was excellent for a working breakfast.   The Shangri-La guest services team responded well to an issue with GC points and voucher redemptions. There might have been some misinformation and confusion amongst staff as I was advised by Lobby Lounge crew that while GC point redemptions were not possible on a PH eve, GC vouchers would be accepted.

Despite the busy CNY holidays, the Butlers at the Lounge makes an effort to ensure we were comfortable during our visit at meal times.   The room, despite its outdated classical design, is well maintained. All the required amenities and little touches more than made up for itâs design.  Would help with a larger TV since chromecast was available.  There are plenty of activities for kids such as Splash the water park, Buds the kidâs club and also Bake, a baking studio. The hotel sure knows how to keep the kidsâ occupied.   We will surely visit again.",10,Feb-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Children below the age of 4 are only limited to the ball pits at buds. They are unable to go on most of the slides. Did not manage to book splash as there were no slots available. If you plan to book splash i believe you'll need to stay 2 night minimum to secure a slot due to the high demand and low supply. If one were to book 2 nights just for a session at splash it would be better to look at the buds annual membership and gain access to their pool without having to stay in their rooms. Good enough beds but way dated decor. But that is only because i was staying in the garden wing.   I believe i would have a better experience if my kids are aged 7 and above. Any younger, it'd be better to head to any other 5 star hotels and play in the play room. Which can be quite sufficientâ¦",6,Feb-22,

A kind staff helped us all the way. As it was a long weekend, buds and splashzone were quite fully booked but they manage to squeeze us in. While getting the welcome drinks, my girl fell on the way and she cheered her up by getting her color pencils and chicken wings. It was a very kind gesture.

Not sure what was going on but I felt quite bad for those 2 staffs. Think if he wants to reprimand/raise his voice them, it will be better to do it in private. Or Maybe even do it nicely.

Special mention to Raja for engaging the kiddo when we dine at the Summit Room, and also Fabien and Bella for their attentiveness.

During check in and after the stay, I gave my feedback to the hotel and Klook that a 4-hr wait for checking in was unacceptable to my family as we had wasted precious time not knowing what to do while waiting.  After giving my feedback, I received an invitation from the hotel, inviting me to come back with my family to a complimentary 1-D stay.  I took up the invitation and asked if a complimentary birthday cake can be given for my October stay because we wanted to celebrate my mother's birthday this time.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Writing this without any ill intention, but just to share sincere feedback hoping that the management of Shangri-La Singapore would take my feedback for improvements.   Long story short, I ordered a Rose Veranda high tea set to be delivered as a birthday surprise to my friend late May 2021, but due to various operational hiccups which I did not expect to happen in a luxury hotel, my order was missed and was not delivered, despite myself following up with the hotel before the agreed delivery time, to which the PIC provided sound assurance that my order will be delivered as scheduled.  What was meant as a sweet surprise initially, turned sour as we ended up surprising ourselves that mishaps like this could happen with a 5 star hotel.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"The hotel is very stingy and not in line with other hotels in the same price bracket. I got the impression that the hotel was trying to nick and dime their guests at every opportunity and give guests the bare minimum that is promised. I would like to take this opportunity to elaboarte.   Firstly, the minibar which was complemenatry with unlimited refills has now been emptied. All items have to be ordered from room service and is chargable. If the hotel is trying to minimise guest contact because of Covid, it would be better for the hotel to stock up the complementary minibar at check in and make it non-refillable. This way, guests would not have to call room service to purchase minibar items and come into contact with hotel staff.   Secondly, The food that is served duringâ¦",4,Jun-21,

The staff remembers that it was my birthday day and sent a cake with macaroons to celebrate the occasion. The staff Susan went beyond and called in to wish me a happy birthday which was nice. The breakfast was sumptuous and good.The slight disappointment was the line al-carte dinner buffet, the variety of food was limited and there was a difficulty trying to know the actual potion of the dishes base on the illustration on the phone.",10,Jun-21,

Our family has stayed in a lot of hotels and this one truly is leading the pack. It was amazing to see 2 chandeliers in our room, an extra-large bed, and experience such immaculate & personal care by the room attendant (Cindy).  She even wrote us a note to say good bye a day before we checked out.   The facilities (Pool, Splash, Buds) were also very well-kept and manned by capable staff. Splash was an especially enjoyable and fun time for the kids.    The afternoon tea and evening cocktails included in the package were fantastic.

One staff, Raja even provided free plain noodles for our toddlerâs dinner on two consecutive nights (the first night we asked, the second night he actually remembered and offered!). Cleaning staff were also very prompt. Needed to change our bedsheet quickly cos toddler spilled water right before his bedtime and Cindy got it done within 10 min.

I read some parents reviews who had their staycation during school holidays with their children before I made the booking at Shangri-La. The purpose for this staycation is for my children because I read good reviews for children to spend their activities during the school holiday.   I was quite keen to book with Shangri-La when I read that some parents were given an early check-in at 10 am during the school holiday.  But not in my case, I had requested an early check-in on Tuesday during the school holiday but was rejected through the phone.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Once again we had a wonderful stay at the Shang which has become our go-to hotel for staycations. Since October, the hotel has implemented the Shangri-la Experience App via a QR code which we found helpful and very easy to use.  The app provides information on the hotel, restaurants and spa along with various hotel services: in-room dining, housekeeping, mini-bar, laundry, etc. This is a great replacement for the old hard copy versions in light of Covid.  We stayed in the lovely Valley Wing.  One thing that really stood out about our room was the excellent work of the housekeeping staff.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),This was our first time to Shang for staycation and I am so glad that we proceed with it even thou the restrictions were still in place. It was a much needed staycation for the kids as it was the school holidays and we couldn't travel due to Covid. The entire staycation was nothing short of fun. Buds and Splash were heaven for the kids. There were also activities such as treasure hunt which the kids get to explore around the hotel. We had in room dining for the 1st 2 days. Breakfast came in a very generous portion and dinner was great. Only some hipcups with the dinner ordering which took a while to get through but this did not dampen our spirits. Overall a wonderful staycation and the kids are asking when can they go back Shangri La hotel again.,10,Jun-21,

The hotel was surrounded by greenery and the feeling was extremely relaxing !  My son loves the Buds and Splash Zone. Due to Covid-19, there were restrictions on the number of guests for Buds, swimming pool and Splash zone. It was a little disappointed as all activities were fully booked upon our checked in. Fortunately, I was advised to put my name on the wait list and it cleared pretty fast! The gym was well equipped and specious, there was only a handful of guests during my visit at 9 a.m. The son mentioned that this was the Best Hotel Ever!

This is also our second stay in Shang within a 6 months period; not my most preferred hotel but the kiddo most favourite. So I think Shang investing in kids friendly facilities is the right approach or business strategy.  This time round, the check in took much longer thereabout 40 mins, probably due to the complexity of my packages but I also realized that the front desk staff who attended to me is most likely a newbie. However, he has performed mostly competently.  The room, as usual, is well maintained and generally clean, except for a flattened bee found within the towel. This is a small issue to me since Shang is a gardenâ¦",10,May-21,

I love the mattress so much that I actually am considering to buy the same series by Simmons!  We had such a good time and the good experience was just unforgettable. I would like to commend that everyone working in this hotel is very sincere in giving their 100% service.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),We had a horrible experience. We booked 6 rooms and theh delayed our check in. They said they would give more importnace to locals than non locals  and ended up giving our rooms at 5pm.  The managemnet was very rude and unprofessional. Would not recommend this place!!!,2,May-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Pros (1) Splash the outdoor water playground was fun with plenty for kids to do (2) Buds the indoor playground was fun too with an art room (3) The steak and Italian restaurants were good (4) Room was big with a huge bathroom.  Cons (1) Super crowded and hotel could not cope sometimes  (2) 1 hour wait for food at first breakfast. Kitchen was overwhelmed and all the guests had to wait a long time for their food. (3) Check in was chaotic. I was told to sit at a table and be called when it was my turn but that did not happen. Other people were allowed to cut queue. (4) Check in counter staff could not help to book activities. Therefore, check in took long as time had to be spent on my phone booking each activity. (5) Room was a bit dated. Would have been great in the 1990s.",6,Sep-21,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"It was a wonderful experience in Shangri-la Singapore from checking in to leaving the hotel. The hospitality in Valley Wing was simply awesome. Keith, Benjamin, Celine, Zi Liang and many others whom I donât remember their name at the Valley lounge was just marvellous. Iâve stayed in many other Marriott (Titanium) and Accor (Diamond) properties in the world and Shangri-la is undisputedly one of the best in the region. I will definitely be back!! Thank you.",10,Aug-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),First time back since covid times. Travelled with a young child and we had an amazing stay overall. We stayed in the garden wing this time and I would say itâs worth the extra for the space and view. Room is clean and well maintained. We tried several f&b outlets while staying here and all the food was good. My son had a great time at splash and buds. The normal pool is also in good condition and not too crowded. All the staff were very attentive and kind to my son and our requests were generally promptly attended to. Only negative was that our bags took almost an hour to be brought to our room after check in and we had to follow up. Will stay again! Definitely recommend this Shangri-La over the sentosa Shangri-La. In future we will continue staying at this hotel and just taxiâ¦,10,Aug-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Probably the best hotel at Singapore! Spacious room, free flow champagne, slash Waterpark for kids, quality breakfast (steak and caviar) and attentive service.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"The moment we arrived at this stunning hotel we were reminded of its tranquility and beauty, the reason we always return here when in Singapore.  The Valley Wing stands out for so many reasons, and a stay here leaves you refreshed, relaxed, and wishing you didnât have to leave. Itâs old school style with attention to detail is so very impressive.  In particular Iâd like to thank Raja, always around to oversee we have everything we need, including never letting our champagne glasses get empty! Jergan for making breakfast the most joyful experience, Peggy for organising my gluten free requirements, Wee Loong for advice on places to try for dining, and chef Richard for the most fabulous high tea and canapÃ© selections.  Staff dressed impeccably are  always on hand for every request.â¦",10,Aug-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"The good:  Beautiful patio with plants and koi and squirrels. Very friendly staff. Good breakfast selection with fruits rotating over days.  The bad: No smoking rooms despite advertising them, which is deceitful and I wouldn't have booked had I known.  Avoid outdoor seating for breakfast, there are gangs of pidgeons and beos just waiting for the guests next to you leave their table to get some tea leaving their food on the table and they will make an absolute massacre of that food with one or two dozen birds, food and feathers flying all over the place. Or kids of guests will throw food to them to similar effect.  Also you'll be required to *reserve* a spot for breakfast via QR code but even doing so might end up with 30 pax waiting.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Comfortable place to stay for sure. My family chose ShangriLa for my father's post surgery stay, and we are not disappointed. The food was good, we tried Shang Palace, Origin Grill, and The Waterfall (we bought bread from Shophouse everyday as well). Shang Palace is definitely our favourite. As for service, all of the receptionists are very very very helpful and friendly. Special mention for Jas who helped me the most since my day of arrival.",10,Aug-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"There are lots of nice touches and highlight but the hotel has aged and a facelift is needed to bring it up to the expectation one has when staying at well stared resort like the Shangri-La. The check-in and check out process was kind, but very long and cumbersome. Itâs a key area that needs up skilling and some tech efficiencies might help. Both processes (excluding waiting time) were 30-40 minutes. An area where the amount of staff didnât make up for incompetencies. Unlike in the Restaurant, where the team varies in skill but sheer volume does cover up small errors. However on two  occasion we tried with little success to order a beer.  The food quality is fine, lots of choice. The Indian section by far the stand out. Venturing out of the hotel definitely deliveries better forâ¦",6,Aug-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Booked the Shangri-La to celebrate a friend's birthday in Singapore and emailed them regarding this. Instead of suggesting recommended celebration add-ons or offering a complimentary cake (which Marina Bay Sands does), the reservations team  chose to advise me of their strict one-person limit for their standard double rooms. I was not intending to bring more than the one allowed guest but I find this reply to be very showing of what the staff prioritize.",4,Aug-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We had our honeymoon at the Singapore Shangri-La. On arrival in our room we had a special cake, Swan towels and petals on our bed.

In summary, kind staff, attentive services, generous and well designed hotel. We celebrated birthday, the amenity and decoration in room was nice. I'm thankful for. I was also given early check-in and late check-out, which gave the chance to explore the hotel as it's big. Breakfast buffet has wide variety and is delicious. Picnic in the garden concept were also good to try (if rain allows!). Would recommend to take pool view rooms, to have resort vibes, and hotel really have exceptional facilities for children!",10,Feb-22,

She informed that I have to wait 10 minutes more as the room was not ready. So, I waited 10 minutes and checked with her the second time. Again, I was told that the room was still not ready and was requested to wait further.  I waited the second time and after a few minutes, I approached another lady at the counter. Once again, I was asked to wait for a while. By then, it was already 3:30 pm, meaning to say it is 30 minutes past the indicated check-in time.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"It has been two years since my last visit to this iconic Singaporean Hotel.  The world has certainly changed due to the pandemic, constant lockdowns and of course the difficulty in travel. All of  these have thwarted my efforts to visit my favourite destination and also my favourite hotel.  Being a guest with over 45 years of experience, it has places me in a unique position.    Checkin didnât go according to plans I am afraid, you see I requested the junior suite facing the pool, unfortunately someone decided that they would allocate my room to someone else. My profile clearly states my preferences but unfortunately even though the request was made well in advance my junior suite was city facing.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Having lived in Asia as an expat for over 30 years, Iâve stayed at many top hotels for both business and holiday.  I can truly say, that the Shangri la, Singapore, is the best hotel Iâve ever stayed in Asia.   We were supposed to stay here one night, en route from Malaysia. We ended up staying here almost three weeks!  I had a major medical drama at the Shangri La.  In the middle of the night I was taken to a local hospital with pneumonia. The staff was helpful and supportive, quickly arranging a taxi in the middle of the night, extending our room and supplying us with special meal requests due to strict diet restrictions after I got out of hospital.  From the cleaning staff to the GM, the friendliness and personal care we received is unequaled in any hotel Iâve ever stayed.  â¦",10,Sep-22,

They also provided a kids pack to my 4 year old upon check in which was a greT touch!",10,Jul-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Just spent a few days for a weekend hide-away. I am a Marriot Bonvoy elite and I am not even in Shangri la circle, so my expectation was not high when I checked in. To my surprise, I was impressed by the nice deluxe room, great hospitality and service received. They even delivered a birthday cake with a warming card to go with it, reaching me finally through multiple efforts. Thanks Yana! Try the table by the pool. With wine and great food from the Italian restaurant, everything is just perfect! Will definitely be back once in a while.",10,Sep-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We had a faultless (near enough) stay at the Valley Wing. We like the Shangri La brand and this is one of their jewels in the crown. First class service throughout which really makes the place. Everything in the valley wing is handled with gracious efficiency and courtesy.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We were having the trip of a lifetime, and Shangri-la did not disappoint. The garden hotel certainly lives up to its name - fabulous extensive gardens planted with palms, orchids and lush borders. Our room in the Garden Wing partly overlooked the massive pool, and partly the gardens. The facilities and service are second to none and there are many in-house eating options. The staff are unfailingly courteous and nothing is too much trouble for them. I could go on with well deserved superlatives, but would just like to mention the Concierge service. Mr Rajagopal Rajkumar and his team were magnificent in booking us some trips. Any issues with the tour company were efficiently ironed out and as a result we enjoyed several wonderful day trips. Their desk was always manned by pleasant smiley faces, albeit masked, and we were very grateful for their presence. Thank you to all at Shangri-la Singapore, we will not forget you.â¦",10,Sep-22,

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We have just spent 12 days at the Shangri-La, and were lucky enough to have a room upgrade from the garden wing to the Valley Wing.  Wow, the room was large and fitted out in luxury.  All the staff were very polite, professional and welcoming.   The room upgrade is actually as it says, you don't get the canapÃ©s, cocktails etc, only the room, but it is so much better its worth it.  So Thank you to the Shangri-La for upgrading us on our retirement celebration. The pool is stunning, with lush vegetation all round, colourful birds and beautiful view's.  One slight downfall was the amount of young children running around and screaming whilst in the water, sadly parents not being considerate to other guests, not the hotels fault. We didn't eat in the restaurants due to our financial situation, but taxi's to Orchard Road and hawker centres were cheap and plentiful. This has been the nicest hotel we have stayed at in regards to luxury, whereas the Pan Pacific/Mandarin Oriental are more business orientated. The internal of the whole complex is opulent and all the small touches make it so special, admittedly we were in the Valley wing.  The gardens are stunning. We can highly recommend this hotel, rates are very competitive, but eating in is on the high side (we'll for us they are). Thank you Shangri-La, you certainly made our holiday special and thank you Sally for looking after us in the Summit Room. We will certainly be recommending you to friends and hopefully will return in the few years.â¦",10,Sep-22,

Yang went to great effort to find us a room when we checked in early. My wife is disabled and needed a rest but our room wouldn't be ready for some time. Yana negotiated a beautiful upgrade for us a d did everything possible during our stay to make is comfortable for us, especially my wife. Rajagopal was an enormous helper every day, giving advice, booking excursions, finding taxis and much more. I think he had the biggest impact on our stay. Our room was beautifully presented and well maintained.   It was my birthday and we were surprised to find a small birthday cake and card in our room. While we were staying at the hotel they also hosted an enormous international security conference that had a massive impact on the hotel, the staff, guests and the whole city, but staff did as much as they could to minimise impact on other guests.

The service staff at Valley Wing are absolutely outstanding! I would like to compliment Mr. Kumar from the bell service desk and Mr. Raja from The Valley Wing Lobby Lounge. They are extremely attentive, especially when they saw that we have a a 5-year old child. They had definitely made our stay very memorable and delightful. Kudos to both of them!  The food quality served at Valley Wing Lobby Lounge was very mouth-watering and palatable. However, we were quite disappointed with the buffet dinner at The Line restaurant.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We stayed in the garden wing for 5 nights. The location was slightly removed from the CBD however its proximity to Orchid Rd and the Botanic Gardens well made up for it. Make sure to book for the restaurants far in advance- we tried to get bookings during our stay and there were none available at reasonable times. The rooms were good with plenty of amenities, an excellent buffet with enough choices for you to eat there every day and always find something new!

The rooms are beautifully appointed with everything you need, breakfast in the Valley Wing a real deluxe experience,  but most importantly the staff here are just excellent. Always a smile, warm, welcoming and so professional. A refreshing observation to actually see management around the Hotel, available to chat and supporting the service team, so important these days given the global staff shortage in hospitality. Will always use this Hotel when in Singapore.",10,Jul-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),Very impressed with this hotel.  Great rooms and great nights sleep which was a bonus in a busy hotel.  The pool and gardens were lovely.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),Found used towels in room. Been given expired amenities. Lack of turndown service. Lack of consistency across all the staff. Been told different answers by different staff members regarding breakfast arrangements. Breakfast table cleared and ready for the next guest while I was up grabbing more food - Is this discrimination against solo travellers? Also found out that GC Dimond status means nothing here as they clearly do not value you.,2,Jul-22,
Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We stayed at the Tower Wing in a one bedroom suite for 11 nights with our two kids (8 and 10). We also had a separate room booked for the kidsâ grandmother and Aunty.   We have stayed at the Shangri-La before and loved the facilities. The grounds are amazing, and the pool is simply wonderful for kids. Those things havenât changed, but a bunch of other aspects of our stay were really disappointing.   First of all, our room was changed without any notice to me to a room in the Valley Wing. I only found that out as we came to check our booking before departure. That meant that grandmother/Aunty would be staying in a different wing of the hotel, which was less than ideal. As a result, I paid to upgrade their room category to the Valley Wing.

We had a city view Garden Wing with balcony and great view. Housekeeping was excellent and efficient. Service prompt and professional. Only disappointing aspect was the service for breakfast. Some staff were less than friendly with seating service. Table service staff however were very friendly. Breakfast is incredibly busy and a bit like organised chaos. Still loved our stay and would return in a heartbeat.,10,Jul-22,

At 500 square feet, the room continues to exude elegance and opulence like the common area of this property. What I like the most was it has struck a balance in creating such ambience without being too old-school. Yes, if you are a fan of W hotels, you might not like the abudant use of wood or this chandelier, but as luxury traveller, I found this room very comfortable and well kept.  Equally impressive is the bathroom, which is big enough to accommodate separate area for shower and bathtub.  The use of marble stone in the bathroom is very typical five star hotels. Also the hotel has used Loccitane as their official skin care products for many years, and you know how good they are.  The swimming pool of theâ¦",10,Jul-22,

This was the first time our 1 year old joined us for the staycation and it was nothing short of amazing. We stayed in the Valley Wing this time and the room is huge, comfortable and stunning (beautiful chandelier). A comfy baby cot and stoke high chair were also provided upon request.

We want to apologise for any rudeness and thank the ShangriLa for making our stay in Singapore an amazing one. A further thanks for sorting our taxi to the airport as well.

Upon checking in, was told my booking didn't include breakfast when I in fact was 100% sure that my booking online had that.

However, after my last stay the hotel did not release my security deposit without any explanation.   It's been three months and the security deposit was still not released. From the front office there is no explanation, simply that they instructed their merchant bank to do so and ""it should be released in a few weeks"".  Not sure if it's a blatant scam or just incompetence. In any case, I paid twice for a week's stay and only get standard emails from their front office staff.

They refused to also refund us so that we could not  find  another hotel either.  Shame on them.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"We were a disappointed in the room and the lobby bar service at this hotel. We stayed in the Tower Wing. We had a king room. These rooms are a bit dated, and oddly configured. The bed is angled in the room, which isnât the best use of space and made an already small room seem smaller. Also, they had slippers in the room but no robes, which seemed odd. Perhaps housekeeping missed it? There was coffee and water in the room, which we appreciated. After checking in we went down to the lobby bar for a drink and a snack, and we never saw our server again after placing our order. Found and drinks came, but had to chase someone down for the check.

Shangri-La Singapore (SG Clean),"Was assigned Room 878. Just stepping in to the garden wing and you are transported into a lush forest. The waterfalls, stream, plants gave off that views. Very stunning and tranquil even before entering the room. The room itself did not disappoint too. At 100 square metres and with a balcony, it was spacious and I loved the wooden fittings. And in line with the resort vibes, the room comes with a ceiling fan too. The bed was a little on the hard side, the pillows a tad soft but still slept like a baby. TV was a 1010 inch Samsung TV. No casting so you'll have to plug in your device via the hdmi ports behind the TV. Controls were by the bedside and includes controls to draw the day and night curtains. No usb ports and the wall plugs were a little distance from the bed so take note if you intend to charge your devices by the bed. The room touts city views but as I was on the 8th floor, no city view but tree top views and to be honest, that was good enough for me. Can hear birds chirping while relaxing in the two lounge chairs provided. It would be perfect if there was a fan in the balcony though as it can get a little too warm. The balcony is very private too and your neighbors (beside you, above or below) cannot peer into the balcony. Nespresso machine provided with 3 capsules, together with instant coffee, 8 different types of tea (Shangri la branding), and two packs of healthy snack (dried fruits). 6 tetra pack (1000ml) of water was provided too with 2 in the fridge. Fridge was decently sized so can fit many things. Toilet comes with double sinks and separate shower and bath tub. Toiletries were by Loccitane and they smelt great. Water pressure was strong enough too and shower comes with rain shower and hand held shower.",10,8-Oct-22,

The condition of the building that we encountered is quite old.  For example, the carpet from the elevator to the room is very worn down.  The corridor is dark. The paint in the bathroom is brown and chipped (quite the contrary of what is shown on their website).  The only fun thing about this hotel is their 2 robots.  One locates in the lobby to assist with guests, and the other one with the sole function of making omelette in the breakfast cafe.  We took a lot of pictures and videos with them.

instead of maintenance coming up and fix the problem, its their security, and he have no idea what he was doing. seeking help from another maintenance through phones, while solving the issues.

Might I add, the shower and toilet rooms are extremely small - a dismal discovery. No wonder their pictures don't really show the toilets at all. 

2. Operators. Their operators were by far the worst things the hotel has to offer. These are the people that takes your call for any service that you might require. I made 2 calls, and both of them ended up inconclusive. For the first one, they made me wait for 30 minutes before I called again for the same request - this took 5 minutes. For the second one, I made a request for extra pillows and a bathrobe. After promptly taking my order, she hung up. The service was never made.

Studio M Hotel,"Staff were polite and tried their best to serve customers. Frustrating to queue for 90 minutes before checking in. The toilet in the hotel room is small just like in aircraft. Shower are is also small and separated from the toilet. The room is crammed due to staircase to the loft. The gymnasium, hotel room especially toilet and shower area require renovation. More staff required to manage check in and during breakfast.",8,20-Dec-21,
Studio M Hotel,"The check in queue took about 1.5 hours of waiting. Upon registration at the concierge , the room is still not yet ready. Had to wait another hour or so. they provided a free drink for the convenience, which I still find myself being shortchanged.

The bathroom and the toilet are too small though. Then they said the pool was already closed but I can see from the window that there are still ang mohs by the poolside. The sofa bed slides easily when you sit on it. But when it slides, you can see the dusty part of the bottom of the furniture. The aircon control is at the bottom part of the room. So if you need to adjust the aircon while you're on bed, you need to go down.

I went back to check to find out the room is ready. After check-in, we went to Memo cafe for meal and unable to charge the bill to the room. Apparently, we have not check in yet?! There's no bathrobes given. Their amenities are so pathetic, like they are cutting cost. The check out time is 11am and given my keys to reception for express checkout. At 4.30pm, I received email and SMS chaser to check out the room now when I already left hours ago. Apparently, we have not check out yet in the system?! No wonder they have no rooms ready to check in people. Either their staff or system is very inefficient. Apart from being a loft, I cannot find anything appealing.",2,21-Feb-22,

Studio M Hotel,"rooms odd , downstairs nice",6,2-May-19,
Studio M Hotel,"The reason for selecting Studio M hotel is the loft room as the children are highly excitable about it. Room suitable for 2. 3 pax are just ok. More than that will be squeezy. 
However the bathroom door cannot be closed properly and the children are afraid that they cannot open the door once it is being forcibly closed.

Studio M Hotel,"I was initially excited about staying at this hotel, the location looked great, I was visiting friends in Singapore who lived nearby and it was close to a vibrant part of town.
The reality was quite different, my room smelt of damp, and felt damp whenever I turned the air conditioning off which seemed to be it's only setting other than full on, so much so that I had to sleep in several layers of clothes. 
The shower 'wet' room was mouldy and smelly, it was clear no one had actually closed the door whilst cleaning in there as there was black mould along the door frame behind the door, and behind the seating bench.
I paid an upgrade to receive six cans of soft drinks in my room each day -  the most undrinkable soft drinks I have ever come across in my life - don't bother!
The safe didn't work, and after spending nearly 20 minutes on hold to reception trying to report the problem I gave up and took a bag of valuables to my friends apartment for the duration of my stay.
I stayed for three nights, on my second morning despite there being hot water in the sink the shower would only run cold, I reported it to reception who assured me they'd send an engineer to look at it, assuming everything was fixed I took a shower this morning to find that it would still only run cold - upon reporting it again at check out I was told that I probably hadn't wiggled the shower control correctly.
I was really looking forward to my 'split level studio' but was left very disappointed

Studio M Hotel,"The service was good and friendly, and was offered a free upgrade. Location is good but the interior of room needs working on. The cleanliness needs to be improved, there was a dead insect on the carpet, the room smelled musky, and I got itchy skin after staying. They forgot to give me bathroom slippers and had to ask for it. The corners above the bed frame to place phones was dusty. I didn't dare use the bathrobes as they looked tattered and worn out. It was sad that they are still using disposable shower gel, shampoo etc, with most hotels moving along to save environment with the refillable wall mounted kind.
Breakfast was good, but even on the weekday it was packed, so much that people had to look for their own table like a food court style, though kudos to the staff that helped to clear the table promptly.

2) When we asked if there can be some arrangement for birthday, the staff insist that we did not indicate during booking. We have not even start discussing what we want for the arrangement and he keep repeating that he did not see any request stated in the booking. We gave up on the request.  If the birthday person is the one who book the stay and the guest wants to ask the hotel if something can be done, obviously the request will not be stated during booking and the staff has no interest to discuss if something can be done. it shows that the hotel cannot accommodate any last minute request. I guess They need timeeeeee and proper application for special request. ",6,10-Sep-19,

It seems fair for the price, maybe a little bit more expensive than you would want given the condition of the rooms. The staff are nice, but are often too little for the demands of the occupants, there is a lot of queuing for the reception desk to get things done, but this is not a reflection of the staff, maybe just resources.

We asked for help to no avail, until I approached an assistant from the Airline Crew Desk who was free. They didnt know what needed to be done either until i found a computer that actually began to read our passports. We checked in as normal on the self service computer, followed the on screen instructions and then find when we get to our room the key does not work. After heading back down i was told it will just take a minute, only to find i was waiting behind another customer who was ringing up a sale and told to have a seat. I could not even get into my room which only takes a few seconds from all the hotels I've been to in the world, not once have i been told to wait to make my room key work longer than 30 seconds. The same assistant from the Crew Desk then took the key and headed back upstairs with myself to let me in with his master key. So now we were without a room key.

It was all a waste of time and had there been a desk available to customers with a person behind to check people in it would be a much nicer experience. The Airline Crew should have a self service desk as they use hotels every few days.

"Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore","The hotel altogether was very good, it was newly renovated in 2019 so the rooms are generally newer. 

1. Cleanliness:
- Bed, bathroom, tables, cups carpet were clean 
- Towels = the extra towels we requested did not smell good at all. It smelled like brand new towels that have never been washed and stored for many months. We requested for replacement, but it still smelled the same, so bring your own.
- Toiletries = they have their own Swiss brand, which did not smell very good, apparently that's the way they usually smell. So if you are conscious about shampoo, body wash etc, bring your own. 

2. Service:
- They accommodated every request we had.
- Before we checked in, I emailed the hotel to request that the rollaway bed for each room be prepared in advance since we would check in at 11.00PM. But upon check in and entering the room, they did not set up the rollaway beds yet, so we had to wait for service to make the following arrangements. 
- Got assistance from concierge re our ART, they were helpful.

3. Amenities & etc:
- Gym = amazingly huge
- Pool = outdated, but still good
- Location = excellent (right above City Hall MRT, central district)
- Nespresso & TWG = enjoyed this every morning
- Room size = small for 3 pax. Bathroom took up most of the space

4. Price = quite expensive since it was peak season, so they increased their price every day, which i noticed, so book right away!

5. Food = , didn't avail for breakfast.",8,19-Apr-22,
"Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore","All was well, except the checking in which took 30 minutes of queuing and another 10 minutes of admin. Luckily I was given 1 hr of late checkout.

"Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore","Overall this was a great stay, great room, great breakfast, etc. However, I can't give any hotel a top rating that doesn't have functional drains in the bathroom sink.

I paid for the breakfast.  Was'nt impressed by the breakfast though.  The food quality was mediocre for what I paid.  Whilst there was a vast selection of foods and choices, it seemed there was a use of mediocre ingredients, which led to mediocre food quality.  Some food was also quiet bland, most notably the Indian food selection.  The sweet pastries were quite firm, which is definitely not how fresh pastries should be, and fresh pastries is what's expected at buffets like these.  The coffee was great though!  O stall, the breakfast leaves alot to be desired.",8,7-Sep-19,

That was a very nice surprise! Breakfast at Qin was delicious. The western setâs portion was huge. As for the sky pool, it was also nice to swim in. I enjoyed the heated jacuzzi the most, as I didnât expect it to be heated. In all, Clan Hotel left a fantastic impression on me.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"I really like this place.  The staff a super friendly and accommodating.   Iâm not a fan of the tea thing they do when you arrive. I found it a bit odd, and all for a thimble of tea and a dry pastry, but some people seem to like it, so I guess its a personal thing. Personally Iâd rather have a chilled glass of bubbly on arrival.  Thereâs no denying the hotel is in a great location, with lots of stuff on your doorstep - and, despite being in a busy area, the hotel is like an oasis of calm. The rooms are very well soundproofed, and I didnât hear any noise from the corridor.  There are basically three types of room. We had two of the smallest rooms called âdeluxeâ.

Although, i doubt they are targeting families.   I must say that when you look at the building from outside, you can't tell it is a hotel. It looks like any ordinary building. But i must warn you not to be deceived by its looks! It is a hotel filled with privacy and surprises as well.   Greeted by a welcome tea + tau sa pia. + some heritage sharing. I love the tea and the packaging. Perfect for gift. It costs 38 bucks.   I love the sky floor gym and pool, in particular the hot jacuzzi.

The reception team, in particular Adrian was very friendly and attentive, it was much appreciated.   We arrived in the morning and was able to check-in (they must have had availability to do so).  Once in the room I was impressed with the cleanliness and features of the room, it was very good.

One of the best features is the filter water tap in the bathroom, easy to drink lots of water and good on the environment as no plastic bottles. My overall rating of 3/5 was entirely due to limited/poor dining, including in room dining. The staff at the restaurant also let the side down as they are not very accommodating.

One particular incident was when upon check in, the staff noticed that it was my husband's birthday. She even went the extra mile to coordinate with me during our clear day so that she could plan a mini surprise for him when we returned to our room! A big shout out to Rachel for going above and beyond. :) She decorated the room with a laminated, hand drawn & hand written card which had a great personal touch.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Kenneth and his team at the Clan Hotel were utmost professionals in their service rendered to my wife and I. We booked the Clan with no prior knowledge of it, only that we liked the ID and the location of the hotel.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Clan Hotel is a modern lux inn unlike any other. You can tell from the clandestine (pun intended) door, gong, staff uniforms, umbrella/brush deco, tea ceremony, in-room tea set, gym Wing Chun wooden dummy, restaurant fusion cuisine etc that this place is going to be a unique experience. I love how the motif blends heritage with the contemporary.   You guys nailed the smart TV with Chromecast, bluetooth speaker, and smart toilet seat. What I'd like to see though, is the ability to call reception or access my room and facilities via an app instead of key cards.

The star amongst the staff I have to say goes to the front desk. Sam, Paulo and Chrisitiania gave such generous and heartwarming hospitality. There were very sincere in serving the guests as âfamilyâ  as one of us.   I was seated at the beautiful lobby awaiting to settle the rooms when Sam came by my side and kneeled next to me to pass the room keys. I was taken aback by this gesture of his.

When we arrive at the hotel instead of the usual big welcoming gate, we were greeted by a smiling staff and a black door.  It seems intimidating but the staff took the opportunity to explain the historical significance of this design.  During the hey days of the clan, admittance to the place is guarded and through a small gate.  When you are considered kin, you will be welcome into the clan which like the hotel is a nice and cosy place.  This little intro marks our interesting journey into the Clan hotel.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,One of the best hotel I have stayed in. Check in was fast and hotel even offered welcome tea but we were rushing to other places and didnât get to enjoy in.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Seemingly a business hotel in the CBD, Clan Hotel is located at Far East Square. While the entrance was not immediately noticeable, the concierge sprung into action to welcome us when sighted and gave us a welcome ""gong"", in the spirit of joining clan activities. Check in was a breeze and reception super friendly to help circumvent limited slots for facilities by extending a late checkout. The simple tea reception gave us a quick update on the beginning of this hotel, in an read when clans and associations used to dominate as well as an appreciation of the earlier way of welcoming guests over cup of hot tea and tow sa pia (local pastry).

You'll enjoy their welcome tea. What we didn't like as much was the pillow smell's a little funny. There isn't a ala carte buffet for breakfast, which could be ignored if their breakfast was any good(Porridge was great though). Good place to stay by yourself if you need a place to pause & reflect, yet it also is a good place to stay if you're travelling to Singapore to work.",8,Dec-21,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,The hotel is modern and layout of the room and facilities is nice and well-planned. The windows offered unblocked view of the city.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Positive - Relaxing stay in the heart of the city, but since it was over the new year period, many near by eating options were closed. The hotel was great, staff was friendly, the room was decent size for a hotel room in Singapore. Interesting highlights include a ""japan style"" toilet, welcome tea ceremony and the pool with a view. Minibar provided, but just a can of coke, sprite and a bottle of orange and apple juice.  Negatives - price a tad high for the location and size of room, its a pretty new hotel, but for the price i feel that there are better options. Breakfast as average, I think there are better options around (if they are open). No bottle water provided, they have a filter at the sink, so bring your own bottles to fill.  Will i come back?

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"First and most importantly, a big shoutout to Paulo for his kindness in taking care of all the little details and going the extra mile, making my very first stay with The Clan extremely memorable and pleasant. Kudos to you, Paulo!  The magic of The Clan begins right when you step through the high black sliding doors with a customary ring on the Gong.  The check-in was seamless and fuss-free. Once done, you're invited over to the welcome reception area to partake in a personal welcome tea ritual.  I had a corner Premier Room, which had terrific view of the city overlooking the conserved shophouses. The rooftop pool was well-maintained and offered great views too.  A great choice to stay with, because you know you'll be in good hands.",10,Jan-22,

You sit riveted in black prestige at the lobby with an orientalist Kingsman feel. Then youâre quietly whisked to your room where the paperwork is done. The Clan is designed to create that behind-the-doors-much-looms secret society feel.  The best looker gym award snagged up by The Clan. Going the distance for a splendid view. The entire building is clevery architected to give you a 360 view.  You never quite see crowds, you get ample space to yourself. I have never met a single soul in the lift.

Comparable to the Ritz Carlton guest services, they made my stay a warm and humane experience and inclusive, too.  Sam Gil, Guest Experience Manager & The Clan Keeper messaged me personally to assure me that he and his team will ensure whatever I have to ask or to seek help, they will be there for me (for their guests), it was that inclusiveness that set them apart from other hotels except for Ritz Carlton. Sam treated me like a friend and we had a pleasant time getting to know, especially when we found out we like strawberries, joked that I should have more of strawberry drinks or snacks.

The pool and gym overlooks the city on the 30th floor and there's a warm spa too.  Front desk service is attentive.  I dropped a star off and gave 4 stars because I did find the hotel a little sterile and just lacking a few extra touches to give it some pizazz and homeliness.  The breakfast is delicious, but it's a set menu whereby you choose one meal from a selection and I found that by our 3rd morning it was just too heavy for me, I couldn't do it.    The bar is quiet and on a nice terrace, it offers 2 for the price of 1 drinks from 5-8pm but they're not keen on you ordering more than one or two rounds.",8,Aug-22,

Tea ceremony during check in is unique. Pool is amazing but quite small, only have around 8 sun beds, so when itâs busy u probably wonât be able to use it. First day our housekeeper was really good, but the second day we got lazy housekeeper that didnât even replace the extra toilet roll and bathrobe amongst other amenities.

Unfortunately I tested positive for COVID upon arrival, and the staff at The Clan were so kind in helping me manage the situation. They treated me with dignity and warmth and went to great lengths to make my isolation period comfortable.  Most impressively, by permitting a late checkout and last-minute adjustments to my reservation length, The Clan staff removed a lot of the stress I would have otherwise endured in trying to get back to Hong Kong... wwhich is still imposing strict COVID re-entry requirements as of this writing, including a negative PCR test.

In addition, the tea ceremony was a big bonus to understand a bit into the history of the hotel and preserving some of its heritage.

At check-in, confirmed reservation was not in the system. Had to wait 2 hours. A nice touch provided, was served a cup of brewed green tea and a slice of mooncake to celebrate the occasion (Mid-autumn festival). Being a Sunday, almost all the shops and eateries were closed. If venturous, hotel pretty close to Chinatown and infamous Lau Pa Sat, street be closed to vehicular traffic and `roadside stall' fanning their satay delight from 6pm.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,My partner and I enjoyed a great stay at The Clan hotel. The location was convenient so close to Amoy St for restaurants and bars and only a short walk to the riverside and marina.  Room was well designed and nicely furnished in muted tones keeping things minimal. The gym and pool have a fantastic view of the city skyline.  We enjoyed happy hour drinks on the terrace before heading out for dinner a few nights. Staff were extremely helpful especially when my partner hurt his ankle and needed to attend A&E. Nothing was too much trouble and they followed up the next day to see how he was and if we needed anything. At checkout we were assisted with our luggage. Thanks for a lovely stay! We will return! ,10,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Staying with The Clan was the best choice! The location was excellent, right next to the MRT and only a 15 min walk from Mariana by the Bay. Chinatown, right outside their door, was interesting and had great Asian food choices! The view from the pool and hot tub was next level, and we had the space to ourselves at 10 AM. My two favorite things about this hotel were the in-room water filter and cups to cut down on water bottle waste and the shower suite. We had a midnight red-eye flight back to the US, so quite a bit of time to kill after check-out. They had no problem holding our many bags for us, and then after exploring Chinatown all day, we were able to come back to get showered and changed before the long flight home.",10,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Comfortable bed and wonderful shower. The room was also so sound proof and had a beautiful view of Singapore. Awesome pool! The staff was very helpful.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"The hotel is in a great location in Chinatown with the Heritage Walk ('Eat Street') commencing behind the hotel and continuing for ever :) The room (Grand Premier King) was clean, comfortable and spacious with a good fit-out. Staff at the front desk were very helpful and accommodating. But... the room was double booked and another guest was trying to move in and share the room with us.  The Qin restaurant was of the view that breakfast was not included while the booking record in reception showed that it was included. By the time this was sorted out, breakfast was over and an 'all day' (big) breakfast offered on the terrace (no aircon outside of course) The breakfast arrangements were a little odd - no buffet, just 6 set breakfast menus. If you only wanted part of one menu, the total had to be ordered and the unwanted components discarded (wasted) The hotel had no cafe/coffee shop where say, coffee and a cake could be obtained during the day. There was a good cafe about 1.5 blocks down the road, but this, of course, was not as convenient as some in-house facility. This hotel is best suited for corporate stays.â¦",10,Sep-22,

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Words cannot describe how perfect the hotel is, right from the minute we entered all the way to the convenience of checking-out. We were welcomed with a gong. At reception, Sam greeted us and offered us a late checkout knowing that it was our anniversary staycation. There was also a tea ceremony where we were served delicious tea and mooncake.   The hotel was booked out the weekend when I checked again but there was no crowd at all (except the pool). Room felt just nice. Layout wasn't too cramped. We had free minibar drinks too! The in-room tea from Pryce fitted the style and feel of the hotel very well. The view from the room was also very scenic! The only thing I had to point out was the toilet bowl detects any slight movement and will start spraying water/sanitising/cleaning so we had to leave the door close whenever we walked past it.   We tried the pool at 4+pm, it was full with people on the sunbed (nobody was swimming), so we went to the gym instead. It was well-equipped. We managed to go the pool again at 8am the next day and it was pretty empty.   We left the room for dinner and had the 'no-disturb' sign on. When we came back, we had a note saying that they wanted to delivery something but couldn't do so and asked us to call them back. A while later, they delivered a note and a bag of chocolates for our anniversary celebration.   Checkout was a breeze. We only had to drop our cards in the express checkout box and we were out.   Thank you The Clan Hotel for a wonderful staycation and we'll definitely come back again :)â¦",10,Aug-22,

Don't come with a lot of luggage as the stairs at the entrance of 10 cross street are very inconvenient. They have luggage carriers, but most of the time, they are swamped, so you will help them to carry your heavy luggage to the elevators for check-in.  The service of the hotel could also be better organised. Our requests were responded late or miscommunicated. ",6,Jul-22,

Lots of cafes and restos in the neighborhood made for a nice morning stroll and coffee run.  The hotel itself was great. The room was super clean and comfortable, and I loved all the thoughtful amenities â the Nespresso machine, Japanese smart toilet, filtered water spout! I also used both the gym and pool which I really appreciated. The gym isn't huge but perfect for my purposes â there was a good variety of machines and dumbbells; if I stayed longer, I would have tried the on-demand classes that were offered on a giant screen. The pool was well-maintained and the view was beautiful. I liked swimming at night.  Highly recommend.",10,Sep-22,

We got a room with nice view, can see sunset in the evening, room is clean and comfortable, mom loves it! The Clan will be our first choice for our annual visit to Singapore.",10,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,I enjoyed my 1st stay in The Clan Hotel in Jan 2022 and this was my returning stay.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"I cannot fault this hotel. I was sceptical if staying as I had read the rooms were small but they were not at all! I travelled with my husband and young child, we had the standard room with a cot and we still had plenty of room to move! The room was clean and I appreciated the bidet and toilet seat warmer.  Bathroom was great!  Breakfast was ala carte menu but one of the best hotel breakfasts Iâve ever had! So tasty and the service was impeccable.  Location was central - close to Raffles Place and Teloj Ayer MRT stations.  Also a short and east walking distance to Lau Passat hawker markets and a Starbucks!  I wish I had stayed long here.",10,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Liked  Â· The Clan Hotel was everything I expected it to be. The facilities are very well taken care of, the features were just like in the online reviews (images and videos). From the time of arrival, during our stay âtill checking out, everything impressed us.  I personally would like to give our heartfelt thanks to Vyan who welcomed us at check-in and even presented us a sweet gesture to celebrate our anniversary staycation at The Clan Hotel. Their guest-service standards are impeccable!  Disliked  Â· The only pet peeve I had were the scent of certain guests who just exited the lifts. Perhaps, better ventilation couldâve avoided this very minor issue and personal hygiene for all of us as guests. I also wished the toilet automatic built-in bidet seats had temperature controls,â¦",10,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"The hotel has a very nice ambience. When we arrived, the tea master wasnât there but we werenât really bothered about that.  Elevators respond quickly and no overcrowding at lobby. Check in might require abit of time, itâll be great to see self check out counters.  Pros: - Very clean rooms - Comfy bed (more to mid-soft type) - Very clean toilets (TOTO automated toilet bidet) - Fragrant toiletries - Nice and good quality tea and coffee  - Average sized room but plenty of room to sit and relax with tall windows - Room service pretty efficient, responsive   Cons: - In-room dining can be improved in terms of menu and set up based on roomâs design. It will be helpful if an entire cart of food can be pushed inside instead of being served on the table dish by dish. Makes it difficultâ¦",8,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"We found the hotel very interesting, unique, stylish and comfortable. The welcome tea ceremony upon our arrival was appreciated. The staff were always pleasant and obliging. Our King room was spacious and well-appointed. We loved the views from our room over Chinatown.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"My room was clean! Perfect, perfect design interior. Sadly the breakfast wasnât buffet and no one told me about this during the booking.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Love everything! Excellent choice! We arrived at the hotel early in the morning from an overnight flight. The receptionist was kind enough to allow us a early check-in as she understood the logistics of long haul international travel times. Fabulous location, just near DT line Telok Ayer, and walking distance to China Town and lot other attractions. Absolutely stunning views from our room on the 17th floor. The rooms were very spacious and had everything you needed and comfy beds and pillows. We were impressed with services provided from arrival till departure. All the service staff are polite and helpful. The whole experience was awesome. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel and we will be back again for sure! Thank you perfect CLAN!",10,Sep-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Good service and excellent hospitality. Breakfast choices were great. Desirable room top pool. But check in may be friendly for older guests or guests with mobility challenges as one needs to carry luggage up a few steps. Without hotel key card, one canât use the ramp at the opposite end of the building",8,Sep-22,

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,The Clan is a nice hotel for short staycation as the hotel is near to a number of good food places around Telok Ayer and Chinatown.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"We stayed for one night with a complementary voucher from Lancome Absolue.  The location is very good, across the street from Tanjung Pager MRT, a few blocks away from Raffles Place MRT, lots of buses around, a stone throw from Amoy Street and the famous Lau Pak Sa Hawker Center is only a couple of blocks away.  The entrance on the ground floor is discreet, with a service table and a black door. We were properly welcomed and the gong was sounded as we entered the elevator. Lobby area is clean and nice, with a tea ceremony area in one of the corner. The front office was very efficient and all was done in 5 minutes.   We were given a corner room, which is great as it has big windows on two sides with a nice city view, giving it a bright outlook. The room is on the smallish sideâ¦",10,May-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Staff are great but work with considerable issues.  Rooms are stylish, but very small. The whole hotel feels ""cramped"" - nothing is spacious. Breakfast is fixed menu (only 6 dishes to chose from). And bookings have to be made via QR code on TV (bad luck if you sleep in or times don't suit your itinerary). Pool beautiful, but only 6 chairs and again, a booking has to be made to use it.  I think they are trying to be ""boutique"" but doesn't really reach the 5 stars they claim to be.",6,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"We had 2 nights in Singapore as a stop over at the Clan and it was fabulous. Great location, next to tube and walking distance to food markets and marina. Rooms were stylish and clean, staff very helpful and the pool at night was spectacular. We had seen reviews stating pool needed to be booked, we didnât do this and managed to use the pool both evenings at night with the most incredible view. We didnât use the gym but were really shocked at how good it looked with great equipment.  Only downside would be breakfast as itâs limited options with only local food choices, which was great to try one morning, however chose to find a local cafe the second morning for pastryâs as we were room only. Would definitely stay again.",10,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Everything about this property demonstrates style and simplicity...two components that can make a business journey much less stressful.  I arrived early on a Sunday morning after a direct flight from the US. Although my room was not ready for check-in, I was invited to freshen up in one of the shower suites on the top floor where the pool and gym are located. This was a welcomed experience after a 17 hour flight and enabled me to catch my breath before heading out to re-visit some of my favorite places in Singapore. I lost track of time and before I knew it, the hotel texted me to let me know my room was ready, (about 2 hours later). Very nice.  My corner room on the 26th floor was a peaceful and tranquil oasis of calm. It was full of wonderful amenities, a lovely bath area,â¦",10,May-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,This is a gorgeous hotel located in the best area of Singapore.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights and could not fault one single thing. The hotel is brand new, immaculate and in such a great location, we could walk mostly everywhere or get a really cheap Grab. Check in and check out were a breeze, airport transfers with the hotel were super easy and staff were always lovely.  The room was a great size, had every comfort we needed and was surprisingly quiet given proximity to other rooms, sound proofing works.  The pool and heated spa are a great addition on the top floor also.  My go to hotel in Singapore, I will be staying again.",10,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Centrally located, this was an ideal place to call home while away. The room was beautifully designed given the space, with the right touches but not overdone.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Great hotel, friendly and attentive staff.  Great atmosphere, clean, modern rooms of a high standard.  Less variety on food and beverage menu that you would expect of a hotel of this standard, and also restrictive timings on room service.  ",8,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"I really wanted to like The Clan.  The decor and fit out were lovely, the location was great, and the service, while we were at the hotel, was ok.  However, a few days after our stay, some charges from The Clan appeared on our credit card (without any bill or invoice being provided). I assumed the charges were for drinks we had at the hotel bar, and which I had tried to pay for at check out, but I was told it had ""all been taken care of"" and no invoice was provided at check out or subsequently.  The charges on our credit card were significantly more than the cost of the drinks.  I emailed The Clan over 2 weeks ago to question the charges, but have not received a response, notwithstanding my 2 further emails following up.  This is disappointing, and not the level of service Iâ¦",6,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Almost embarrassing at times the lengths staff were prepared to go for you. All very diligent and friendly. Hotel very modern and clean.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"This really is an incredible location to explore the city. Next to Telok Ayer MRT and pretty much everywhere you want to get to is two or three stops away, but there are also so many bars and restaurants within easy walking distance for breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner including two hawker centres. For that reason we had room only.  However, we did eat breakfast once for the experience in the hotel and it is worth trying. In our case, especially so as we got it free as part of the compensation we were given after we got stuck in the lift on floor 30 for 20 -30 minutes. To be fair, I can't fault their response to that - we also got a free limo to the airport and a late check out; we probably could have demanded more but as they were so good about it we didn't want to push it.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"New, clean, spacious rooms. I was given a room on the highest floor, 29, only 1 level below the gym & swimming pool. Amazing view. I especially love the design of the room! It's photogenic from every angle, and I took many photos it. Love the sliding partition door, the sink outside the toilet, and the heated toilet especially. The teas were also amazing. Another thing I want to note is that the hotel delivers our grabfood deliveries right to our room, which some hotels don't do. This extra service is greatly appreciated. No complaints about the cleanliness of this new hotel - room and facilities were top-notch. A very satisfactory stay, would recommend.",10,May-22,

Truly a remarkable accommodation spot!",10,May-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"A modern and very clean hotel with excellent and very helpful staff. Situated reasonably close to all major city based work and tourist destinations, the Clan is now at the top of the Singapore hotel list for me. The hotelâs modern but subdued vibe and very clean rooms provide better value for money than most of the larger and well known hotels in the city. The corner rooms and the higher floors provide and excellent view of the cityscape. If thatâs not enough to make you seriously consider staying here instead of one of the bigger hotels, I left my travel documents in the safe when I checked out and the Assistant Sales Manager (Joshua Choo) personally delivered them to me at my office.. Thatâs the extra service that gets a huge tick of approval and recommendation from me. Iâ¦",10,May-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,The location so close to Chinatown and the finance district makes this hotel really convenient to get around. MRT stop right on the doorstep.

If not, there is a MRT station opposite the hotel which connect to everywhere. Lots of F&B outlets nearby the hotel whole day long.   I had excellent stay during my trip. Upon arrival, I had a chance to try both welcome tea & tau sar pia (local delicacy). Hot: Oolong (if I remember well) & Cold: Osmanthus tea (I prefer cold one). The room size is great for a city hotel and I enjoyed the turn down service very much - in-house ritual tea. The swimming pool is operating 0600-0000hrs. Gym is 24hours.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,A very new establishment by Far East. Very oriental feel. Small and cosy. I love the scent of tea leaves when I entered the property. It is so different from the many hotels which I have been for staycation. The infinity pool and jacuzzi is beautiful. Evening view of sunset and night view by the pool is so calming. Not kids friendly as I consider this as business hotel given the location at CBD area.,10,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Stayed one night with to kids in a premier room during a stay over in Singapore on my way to Bali.

Love the heated dipping pool with air/bubble jets!   I booked their Grand Premier Room this time around as the third stop for my birthday hotel-hopping staycations.  From all the hotels I stayed in, this is the only one which had my food ordered from outside/other vendors personally brought up to my room - without asking for it! Very considerate & thoughtful of them. If you are a foodie and would rather eat out, no problem! Itâs location is ideal and very near so many restaurants.

The staff are really friendly and attentive from the check in to the tea ceremony and even the breakfast service where they explained the chefâs special for the day.  The room was really comfortable and cosy, my favourite parts were the bluetooth speaker and SMART TV where we easily casted netflix and youtube. The TV is adjustable too so you can move it to face any part of the room.  The windows and seats are really comfortable and perfect for relaxing by the window to enjoy the amazing view of chinatown.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Overall nice hotel, very clean and professional.  Improvement needed however on their dining experience: although the quality of their food is of a high standard, it was disappointing that the restaurant closes so early. Even more, much sooner than mentioned on their website, staff already urges you for a final call and to leave the restaurant.  Roomservice isnât an alternative because although a nice menu is available through your TV set, you can not even get a diet coke around 22.30 PM, because the guy at the reception tells you that as the restaurant is closed, he canât bring you that.  Disappointing",6,Jul-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,The room and the hotel are very nice but the service is far from a 5 star hotel. Check in was very slow and the luggages were delivered very late. we tried many times to call concierge and in dine room service and nobody pick up the phone...,6,Jul-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Located just next to telok ayer mrt. The accessibility to the hotel is so easy. Even if you want to walk, it is just a mere 5-8min from chinatown point. Everywhere there are food choices to be spoil with. The hotel itself has a very interesting entrance with the access card only. Chinese heritage can be seen sharing across the hotel spaces, even in the room. Though the prices of the room is abit pricy, cannot deny the fact that it is near the CBD area.

It's one of the most convenient hotels to be based at for short- and medium-term trips.   As a new hotel, what attracted me was the hotel's identity and back-story. It is located on the fringes of Chinatown, the Amoy Heritage Zone, the CBD and Club Street/Lau Pa Sat, which gives you a chance to craft your day or night as you feel like it.   Thoughtful details in the room like the Nespresso machine, clean filtered water and a wraparound view of the surrounds added to the experience. ",10,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Family staycation. Awesome guided tour and excellent breakfast. Conveniently located and you can get to attractions like Gardens by the Bay easily. Room view is fantastic as well, with a good mix of city skyline and conserved buildings.  ",10,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Clan. A premium boutique hotel in a great location to explore both Chinatown and Raffles Place area on foot. Just over the road from blue line MRT and 5-10 mins from Red/Green line.  The little touches were excellent and the theme of the Chinese heritage were evident throughout. It was a joy to come back and relax after a day out exploring, and the rooftop pool was intimate and serene. The fitness centre was EXCELLENT.  We stayed in the Grand Premiere room, a friend stayed in the Premiere room. Both bedrooms identical size and features but different colour scheme. The Grand Premiere has a much larger bathroom with bath. If bath isnât important to you, book the Premiere.",8,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Walking distance to MRT station ,and so many nice restaurants and bars nearby.   Hotel room is small but well designed with attractive details.   I like the most is they using water purifier instead of bottle water .  Breakfast have limited choices but staffs are friendly and serve quickly.  Great pool,,gym and views.  highly recommended! ",8,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Service, food, amenitiesâ¦ it is no more than a 4* hotel team and management in a 5* hotel building. It does not worth the price, better go to Kempinski or Intercontinental. At least those hotels know their job.",2,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"The room did not feel tiny (even though it was only 24 sqm), the smart TV 55"" was excellent, the water filter was so genius, so we didn't have to ask for bottled water over & over. Problem was with design of the shower room drainage, which did not allow the water to freely flow , and to lift it will need a screwdriver which makes the housekeeping job a bit difficult.  Breakfast eligibility was not passed on from Reservation to Reception and to Breakfast Admission for 2 days from total 4 nights of our stay.  Other than that this is a great hotel, still very new, very clean, location is superb, we like it so much.",8,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,"Booked Grand Premier room for 2D1N. Room with bathtub was pretty and clean. Hotel was nice to do up a simple decoration in the room and provide a complimentary small cake for birthday. Breakfast was lackluster, not buffet, tasted normal and 1 hour timing was limited. Staff rushed us to go off even before the 1 hour slot was up. Service at reception and Qin restaurant was average, could have been much better for a 5 star hotel. Please only stay if you have a good promotion code.",6,Jun-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,We had an amazing time staying at the Clan hotel! Perfect location across the street from the MRT and walking distance to local coffee shops as well as Lau Pa Sat a fantastic hawker center. Even walking distance to Chinatown. Everything else is easily accessible by MRT or taxi. The hotel was so clean. Every room has a heated bidet. The infinity pool is on the small side but gorgeous city views especially at night. The staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodating and they even let us check in 4 hrs early when we arrived. Oh and VERY comfortable bed and STRONG air conditioning. Best hotel experience weâve ever had!,10,Jun-22,

Opposite the Telok Ayer MRT, which makes it very convenient to get anywhere else.    The hotel itself is brand new with beautiful interior design and the aroma of tea that permeates through the entire hotel.  The gym  and pool (infinity) are stunning, functional with beautiful views of the surrounds.    Shout out to Faiz who was more than happy to give us advice on places to eat and where to get laundry done.  He made our stay at The Clan special.",10,Jul-22,
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality, Awesome service. Was greeted with welcome tea and snacks. The room has a minibar with free snacks. Coffee machine and premium tea sachet.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Great location and the rooms are in good condition and well cleaned by the friendly staff members.   We had access to both the Straits Club and main dining area. Less on offer in the Straits Club for breakfast. We also had on offer afternoon tea and pre-dinner cocktails.   Would be nice if greater range of drinks etc was on offer around the pool.  Recommend returning.,8,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),The toilet was my favourite features as the toilet seat opens automatically when it senses you are near. The toilet seat is powered to be hot and the there is a remote to control the pressure of the water which is hot also. Bathtub was spacious,8,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Canât fault the hotel on accommodation and cleanliness excellent â¦only problem room service finishes at 11pm and you canât get a coffee in the foyer after 5pmâ¦breakfast was good only drawback was coffee is out of a machine  so I asked for a fresh cup at the table which they did â¦,10,Jul-22,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Second stay at this hotel and last yearâs stay was way better than this year.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"My second time staying here. Overall experience was pleasant and my family enjoyed their stay. Staff were friendly and provided us with good service.   For the breakfast buffet, there was a variety of dishes. Definitely worth it.",10,Jul-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Just disappointing as we expected nothing but excellent service.  Very underwhelmed with the whole experience.  We were out for the full day and came back to an uncleaned rook.  It took 45 minutes to resolve but then no one informed us it was finished, we had to chase staff to find out if we could go back to the room.",6,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"It was wonderful!

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"In my previous review (which i had to delete in order to make an upate to my review), I shared about how I was being wrongly billed (charged 2 times the original amount) for my 3D2N stay at the Palladian Suite.   After calling to clarify, the hotel responded via a call after 2 days by front office manager, Darshan Lionel. Though I would appreciate for the call to be made much earlier, I would like to thank Darshan for addressing this payment issue. He gave me a direct number to contact him and tried to expedite the refund. He also followed up with messages to check on the status of the refund. After the refund was made, Darshan offered my family a complimentary dinner buffet at the Town restaurant to compensate for the unpleasant experience.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Where do I start and for full disclosure, I will be honest. I stayed here as apart of ht AMEX promotion that I was offered a free night here and I took it. What struck me first was how useless the doormen were. I dont understand why they are there when they watch you take your bag out of the car. While this isnt a problem, they did watch me, something which I find uncomfortable if they see me.   I then at check in asked for an upgrade at check in, with the AMEX promotion offering me an internal courtyard room. I wasnt a room that had an outdoor area, I was offered an Esplanade room for 50++ and then offered a Collyer Quay Suite for 300++. i took the former, having been promised it had an outside aea, and WOW, it had solid brick walls in front of the windows.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Room is spacious for 3 of us. Previously we had the Fullerton street view but this time our room is in the inner wing. Request for toiletries for 3rd person took quite long, claiming to be busy that weekday afternoon. Overall a relaxing experience as we're not allocated near families with young children. Internet connection was reliable and we could all work and study at same time.",10,Jun-22,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"The service provided at Fullerton Hotel was impeccable. We were impressed by the hospitality shown by Fullerton's staff - Anne and her team were accommodating to our needs as we prepared for our wedding.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"A lovely extended family staycay, with old folks, adults and teens. Great hotel, service and staff. We had the Courtyard rooms which are spacious and clean. Bathroom/toilet is clean and big. The feather/down pillows get a bit too soft over time, so stack them up. Toiletries and amenities provided are good. Gym lacks some weight equipment while the pool is an average-sized rectangle. Good that thereâs chilled orange/lemon-infused drinking water provided at the poolside. Kids below 12 can get a daily free scoop of ice cream. Meals are a bit expensive but there are also lots of dining options in the vicinity. Easy walking distance to the promenade across from MBS and ArtScience Museum for photo-taking, and a short walk to Merlion Park. Hotel is also just across the Cavenagh Bridgeâ¦",10,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Beautiful Hotel although a little tired in some areas. Great location. Room was lovely, clean, great bed linen & pillows.

The moment I stepped within 50 metres from the hotel I could feel that this one is gonna be different, it has been a while since I last stepped into a hotel ever since ahem ahem (you know), but everything at The Fullerton made me feel like the travel scene has never left! The place was lively, the lobby was filled with people, the lounge was almost full house, there was even a short queue at the front desks! (It was really a very short wait so donât be alarmed by that hahaha) the front office agent was able to answer every need and queries that I had raised, of course as expected, the check in process was super efficient and I was in the elevator up to my room in minutes.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"My wife and I spent 5 days here in mid-June. It has a lot of history and the decor is very attractive and reflects the high standing of this iconic building. It is very well located and a short walk or taxi ride to many things and places in Singapore.  The Highlight  for us was the Straits Club. Super people looking after us - Lucy and Jared were names we recall, though everyone in the Club was superb.  The  sea or river view rooms are best - the Courtyard rooms havenât much of a view. One criticism is rather dark corridors.  The breakfasts were excellent - Omelette chefs especially good.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Everyone in the hotel were super attentive, friendly and efficient. The rooms were always impeccably cleaned. We love the breakfast buffet - especially the local food of Nasi lemak and laksa - and of course the usual staples of a full English breakfast. We stayed there for almost two weeks and towards the end, everyone was calling us by name. We had a chance to use the pool, and it was really unique to swim in the evening right next to the Singapore river and watch the lights as they came on.  There were several of us and we took different room types and all of the rooms were amazing.  As a heritage hotel, the fullerton has managed to retain the old world atmosphere with the modern conveniences.  The best of both worlds.  I could not recommend this higher.",10,Jun-22,

The hotel is spectacular from the moment you enter. We had a room overlooking the river with views of the city from our balcony on the 7th floor that I highly recommend. Sit outdoors for breakfast and enjoy a mimosa and a cool breeze before the heat gets intense.

We were told that the breakfast buffet had recently been reintroduced and it works well.  There are no physical menus anymore so you have you scan the QR codes to get the menu choices.

Tweaks that hotel needs to make are the following: -Food needs to move up a notch in terms of sophistication. Buffet breakfast is expensive at $45 per person. There should also be an a la carte option. Salmon burger, yikes, was pieces of nova with lettuce and tomato.  -Singapore can be very hot weather.

Itâs hard to be discreet with such a large troop but Darshan (the front office manager) on duty and his team  were ever so ready to make us feel right at home with ice cream, plush toys and colouring book for our kids.   When we went for dinner later that evening, the kids were famished after their swim. We told the staff on duty to prepare something that was not on the menu as our daughter is a fussy eater.

On arrival to our room realised that the courtyard room had no natural direct light and asked for alternates with direct light and was moved to an outward facing room for a very reasonable amount extra with ease. Facilities ie gym were great, swimming pool was nice but not many beds and you canât order food which was frustrating when relaxing at the weekend before leaving but equally not a deal breaker (drinks can be served).

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Overall it was a great experience staying at the Fullerton. Impressive room and great service. Staff at the executive straits club were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately there isnât much food to select for breakfast or high tea.,8,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"On my last trip to Singapore, I had the legendary Sunday brunch here but this time I had a luxurious few days at this stunning hotel. The location is amazing, especially when taking breakfast outside on the terrace. The staff could not be more helpful or friendly. I love the way that they showcase the history of the hotel so well yet appeal to modern tastes too. Expensive but recommended!",10,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"The staff at the Fullerton put a smile on my face.  They were all so gracious and accommodating.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We had a fantastic time during our stay. All the staff were polite, warm and hospitable.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"This is a truly spectacular property in the heart of Singapore.  Everything is gorgeous from the lighting to the furniture to the bathroom fixures, and impeccable staff are everywhere you might need them.  Best of all is the location which makes nearly every downtown trip walkable even in Singapore heat.  I would just note that because this hotel is fitted to what was previously a post office, there are some design compromises, particularly in the rooms which are smaller than other Singapore hotels, and many rooms are interior facing to the vast lobby, thus receiving less natural light.  The lifts are a bit slow as there aren't so many available.  Again, these are inherant design contraints due to the building layout, they are not fatal flaws - just something to be aware ofâ¦",10,May-22,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),We enjoyed our stay in the heritage rooms with spacious balconies. The housekeeping staff was very good despite the hotel being nearly full. The breakfast is very good as well except the staff serving can sometimes appear disinterested (hence the 4 star rating and not 5),8,Apr-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Perhaps it was because we visited during the labour day holiday, but check-in was delayed by 2.5 hrs and there was no clear communication, so we spent a lot of time waiting. Breakfast was average, pool was really small, and all in all we expected more from a 5 star hotel.  Room was nice though, and it was clean.",6,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"It was overall a good staying experience in Fullerton Hotel. However, experience in Jade was just normal. First of all, The staff mention that it will need 3 weeks to secure a table in Jade. We will not be able to know unless there is notification from the hotel. Even if there are notification, normally we donât book staycation in 3 weeks in advanced. Should take note of this. Thank you.",8,Jun-22,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"My family and I stayed in the Premier Collyer Suite for 2 nights from 8-10 June. We try to stay there every year as it was the place my wife and I were married in, and every year we are spoiled by the wonderful service and beautiful hotel.   This year, with the pandemic slowly easing up in Singapore, normal service is slowly resuming, and this meant a buffet spread at the Straits Club for Breakfast, Tea and Evening Canapes. This is something that you shouldn't miss if you get club access. We particularly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea, with the great selection of teas and the famous scones. The staff at the Club are attentive, caring and friendly, which really made a big difference this time around.   Though we did not get to use the amenities, the easing of the pandemic also meantâ¦",10,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"During my recent stay, The Fullerton was able to convince me almost completely. The experience began at the airport with a pre-booked private escort service at the airport and transfer in a state-of-the-art E200 Mercedes limousine. To my great delight, I was able to check into my room (Marina Bay View with access to The Straits Club) as early as 9:00 am and was generously given the opportunity for a second breakfast at ""The Straits Club"". So I could already use the arrival day for the main reason of my trip: Sightseeing. The room was located on the seventh floor and was equipped to the standards I had set for myself. A highlight was certainly the small balcony with a view of Marina Bay. Both for a coffee at sunrise or a sundowner with a view of the daily light show. Alsoâ¦",10,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),We Stayed here from 7-11 June had 3 rooms in the hotel. I think it is fair to say this hotel has cut down heavily due to covid had the exact same breakfast each and every day and the spread was also fairly average. My mother who is a vegetarian had the same breakfast every day  for the 4 days we stayed in this hotel.  Their so called Fullerton express service was bare basic and no one ever answered the call. The hotel has no late night room service and the in room dining menu is bare basic. We booked each room for SGD600+ per night these things are bare basic when you pay this kind of money. The hotel staff is also average not warm at all. I suggest you look at other hotels which will treat you better for the money you pay. Also if they are still keeping there prices up theyâ¦,6,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"I would like to commend the Courtyard Team especially Mr Lalikumar and the other gentleman for their prompt and warm hospitality during my visit yesterday. Our requests of vegetarian and regular set is being met before we reached the place and our food were also served very fast. Top ups and 2nd helpings to refill were also initiated by Mr Lalikumar and team without prompting. It is indeed very impressive and we feel very welcome.   Sweets and savouries along with tea is free flow. For its price and quality, I feel it is a great value for money. I also feel it is a great idea to have a vegetarian set as I can enjoy the tea with my non vegetarian friends too!   We also had complimentary parking which is a nice gesture.

Hope this can be improved.",8,Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),you wont be able to feel be welcomed at this hotel as they are fully booked. The $200 credit they gave us to eat at the restaurant just for fun as we couldnt book at any restaurant. Finally they sent us to the Lantern rooftop bar for some nasty food.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"kids and i have always loved our staycation at Fullerton Hotel. This time, we booked the Pallidium Suite to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my hubby.   There was a dedicated check-in at level 4 for suite bookings.  The breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails during our stay is very enjoyable.  Room is very clean with amenities that we needed for our stay. The only issue is the sofabed - not very comfortable and is a little squeaky. Haha.  Special mention to 2 staff at Straits Club, Lucy and Siti for the amazing customer service.  Lucy is my kids' favourite auntie. It was the first time my kids came to tell me how kind and wonderful a particular service crew has been and that person is Lucy.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Last few weeks travelling mostly for a holiday but in part business. This Hotel is very well located and services provided are exceeding good. I intend to return to Singapore and will book again to stay at this Hotel,10,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Great staycation with awesome service. The food at Jade restaurant is very good too. There's special National Day Celebration which provides local snacks and treats which everyone enjoyed themselves!,10,9-Aug-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"I had a pleasant stay at The Fullerton, will come back for sure in the future.",10,3-Jul-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"The best! Had booked the Marina Bay View Room and the view was extremely breathtaking. The hotel had also prepared a mini cake for us as we were celebrating our birthday and anniversary there! Thank you! Housekeeping was also extremely prompt and speedy! Staff were also extremely polite and courteous! However, there were ants crawling around on the desk but they disappeared afterwards. Wonderful stay and I will be back!",10,11-Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Stayed here for 3D2N to celebrate our 1 year old's belated birthday. Service was excellent all around, from check-in to housekeeping to check-out. We were greeted with a smile and a warm greeting whenever we bumped into any staff and our little one was pampered with a coloring book and crayons (provided for free)! We especially loved the huge room size, tub and heated pool, our little one enjoyed all of it. He had such a great time and as parents it made us very happy. We ordered room service for dinner as we had $ 100 dining credits and the food was delicious. Salmon perfectly cooked. Highly recommend everyone to book a stay here. You won't regret it!",10,8-Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"With the 200 dollars voucher dining experience is bad due to jade restaurant does not give me a chance to enjoy like weekend dim sum. The staff told me is fully booked and even dinner time also fully booked. In order to utilize the 200 dollars dining voucher, we went to town rest to eat however the food is just acceptable.",3,7-Jun-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Had an enjoyable stay at The Fullerton Hotel! Loving the historical tibits and drawings around the hotel, as well as the clean and spacious rooms! Service at the Straits Club lounge was attentive and quick:)",10,3-Oct-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"A splendid and memorable experience, elevated by great details in terms of property and in room experience. Would happily return either on biz or with family. Breakfast area and quality were good, the public spaces are large and expansive, and the whisky bar was a fun end of night treat on one eve! Thanks to all the helpful and attentive staff",10,Apr-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Overall quite satisfied with the stay except for the check-in. Delayed of slightly more than an hour after check-in before we were given the keys to our room. However, given the stay was during long public holiday, could expect the crowd but thought the management could have better managed it.",8,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"The rooms were clean, the location is central, check in was well organised and smooth even though it was a long weekend with many families.  The pool is not big but good enough to have fun with great view of Boat Quay",8,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Booked a stay in Premier Courtyard Room 788. As the name suggest, the windows of the room faces the atrium. But no issues as the atrium is naturally lit by the large translucent glass from the ceiling. As a result, the room has natural light coming in as well. Only issue is the opposite rooms may be a little close so keep at least the day curtains closed in the day. The room is a huge 82 sqm, with the toilet very big as well. What I love is the sofa set placed directly in front of the bed, and facing the TV as well. So, do not have to swivel the TV to face you. But, the TV can still be swiveled if you intend to watch the TV from the round work desk. Speaking of TV, it is a Samsung TV but Chromecast is available so no issues even if you use an iPhone. No need to bring a TV stick to watch your favourite Netflix shows. The bed is comfortable, with 2 pillows each. An extra pillow can be found in the wardrobe as well. You can choose from a variety of pillow types. Minibar is available but items are chargeable, except for 2 small Tetra Pak mineral water (330ml) and 8 Nespresso capsules (all different flavours) and 8 twg tea (8 flavours). Night Curtains are electronically controlled but day curtains have to drawn manually. The room also comes with a harman/kardon Bluetooth speaker that sounds as good as it looks. The toilet features a Toto washlet with seat warmer, washing and the likes. There is even a remote control that you can press. The toilet cover opens automatically when it senses you are near. Very cool. Separate tub and shower area. Shower area has a stool provided so you can bathe sitting down. Never knew how good that felt. The rainshower Water pressure was strong. Tub is huge and fills relatively quickly. As I informed the hotel I was celebrating my birthday, a small slice of chocolate cake was waiting for me in my room when I checked in. A small but nice gesture. Other features of the room include many artworks in the room and toilet. In fact, all around the hotel. All in all, a very comfortable stay. May try a different room type if I have the chance to do so in the future. Besides the lovely room, I had lots of fun taking photos of the architecture of the hotel. Housed in the Fullerton Building, it was built in 1928 and served as The Central Post Office until 1996. Various Government Ministries were based in the building over the years as well. The building was then refurbished and opened as The Fullerton Hotel in 2001. All this and more information I learned during a complimentary Fullerton Monument Tour which took around an hour. Email to the concierge to book a tour and check hotel website to see tour dates and timing. Hundreds of paintings are placed all over the hotel and in hotel rooms and toilets and they all either depict historical or prominent monuments in Singapore. Photos taken in the day and at night have different characteristics and feel and the hotel is so big that there are photo opportunities in every corner. A photographer's dream! This infinity pool is the pool to beat most infinity pools. 1.2m deep and long enough to do laps, the pool is also heated to around 27.2 degrees, with panel by the side of the pool showing this information and other information such Ph and chlorine level. The pool also has many jacuzzi vents by the side. Deck chairs are aplenty as well. To cater to kids, the rule is that children below 12 must wear the lift jackets that are provided by the poolside. The best thing about the pool is the view, especially at night. The lights of the CBD buildings, and from both the Anderson and Cavenagh bridges, coupled with the views of the Singapore river and the boats that ply the river are simply breathtaking. Together with the heated pool, this makes an unbeatable combination.",8,10-Aug-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"My wife and I spent only an overnight staycation at the Fullerton, without setting up any sort of expectations. The outcome only served to whet our appetite for more opportunities here and certainly what we experienced went beyond what we would have imagined - attention to details in the room and at the lounge, kind and welcoming front desk experience and check-in from the Straits club lounge and the warm hospitality of our hosts - Crystal and June - made the whole 24 hours worth its while! Good job, Fullerton!",10,May-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),had a very nice and comfortable stay! The location is fabulous and so are the views and proximity to all key areas in the CBD. Rooms are just the right size and nicely equipped with all modern facilities. Breakfast experience was great though the place was totally deserted in evenings as guests were hardly seen at the F&B outlets. Staff is very polite and courteous too.,10,Apr-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Simply fall in love immediately after entering this famous Fullerton Building at the center of the city! Every corner is full of history!!!   The staff are very nice and helpful! They first surprise us by arranging special decoration inside the room (I only mentioned to the hotel restaurant that my afternoon tea is for celebrating our anniversary but I didnât tell the room reservation!) with two lovely bears holding the balloons (and we can take them HOME!!!!)  There is complimentary update and the room is clean, capacious and comfy!  Thanks Kate, front desk staff, for helping me assisting me to finish an urgent document at work by printing the document hard copy for me and guide me for postage back to Hong Kong ! Excellent service.  I MUST thanks Albert in the Courtyard at the lobby of Fullerton. He saved me from misunderstanding the hotel!!!! I written to the restaurant 2 mths prior arrival to book their famous afternoon tea for anniversary celebration and I really had extremely high expectation bez I am fan of afternoon tea!!! I was so frustrated and furious when I start eating the tea as the taste was sooooooo horrible and unacceptable until I cannot tolerate â¦ my hubby saw that we are having a different set from other peopleâ¦. We were given a vegan set!!!!! Albert came to assist us and letting us know that according to their record, we have requested that ! We were sooooo puzzled and shocked!!! He really handled this very nicely and gave us a complete new afternoon tea set and new coffee/ tea to relieved our emotion !  Later, we searched back the email that at the very very beginning I told the reservation team that I am interested in their plant- based menu (which I donât realised it is a completely vegan set when I looked at the menu two mths ago) !  I really highly appreciate Albert professional handling of guests and customers that he didnât make me feel bad even eventfully I found out it is my mistake to cause misunderstanding. The way he served us make us feel not so embarrassed and saved our anniversary celebration! He told just we still have time to enjoy ourselves ^^ I feel so good for his hospitality!!!!!  Experienced staff like Albert with kind heart and hospitality is what an excellent hotel should treasure and value! Thanks a lot for saving our celebration and my impression to Fullerton (not to misunderstand bez if my own mistake)â¦",10,Aug-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"The holistic service provided by Fullerton hotel was nothing short of perfect. From the restaurant (Courtyard) to the in-room dining service, you could tell that their staff were trained very well as itâs reflected in the impeccable service provided to me during my short stay there.  Special mention to Lalikumar (pardon if the spelling is off) from the Courtyard. His attention to detail was highly commendable. Knowing that my family and I have certain dietary restriction, he went beyond his duty to cater to us by substituting the item in our high tea set.  All and all, thank you for the awesome stay and I look forward to another superb staycation at the Fullerton hotel, hopefully in the near future âºï¸.",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We have stayed at The Fullerton a number of times previously. Never disappointed. It is truly a fabulous hotel in every aspect. This time we stayed 9 days. Our room was very clean and comfortable with great views out over Marina Bay. The bathroom was spotless, had lots of space and amenities. Our room was on the same floor as the Straits Club, so access was easy.  Nicholas, Siti and the Team at the Straits Club were as usual proactive, attentive and extremely helpful. Food and drinks were high quality and very tempting. Ryan, Chia Yi, Crystal and Zep provided exceptional service. They made our stay most enjoyable.  We took the Fullerton Heritage Tour this time. Bill the tour guide was very knowledgeable. The tour brought back wonderful memories for us, as we used to post lettersâ¦",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Came to The Fullerton Hotel Singapore for a business conference. The location is convenient and decor is immaculate. Would love visit this location again.   However, the service staff can be quite unhelpful, preferring to tell you ""I don't know"" instead of giving some assistance - I was trying to find a charging port for work and one of their wall ports was not working. I tried look around the lobby and instead of directing my to any functioning ports, preferred to tell me that I am not allow to sit at this or that location. Not sure if this is the kind of service I would like to bring my clients to.  I think Pan Pacific would have been a better choice.",6,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"First time ever visiting Fullerton Hotel Singapore last week.  was in awe, very beautiful and super clean rooms, very friendly staff, the breakfast buffet was out of this world! They even had a piece of birthday cake for me at my arrival of in my room..so thoughtful! I hope on my next visit to Singapore, i can stay there again, very recommendable!",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),This is a truly high end property.  I would recommend this place over MB Sands any day.  Feels exclusive and does not have the swarms of tourists that you find across the bay.  Very pleased with the room size and staff service.,10,Aug-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"What a luxurious hotel with historic features and classical beauty. This hotel  will be the first and last classic moody hotel in this bustling city center.  Esay to meet view of famous marinabay hotel at any angle within 5 min walk distance.  The afternoon tea set was  oppulent and accompanied by relaxing music .Great location, a walk away from  trendy hotspots.",10,Aug-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Superb facilities, comfortable room and strategic location.  Concierge service specially Chandra was awesome from guide to check in counters, introduced all the function in the room to carrying the luggages and bags with smile and care plus looking out for the cab while I sit back and rest. Well done",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"A well maintained historic hotel in the  heart of Singapore.  We stayed here as a family of 4, driven all the way from Kuala Lumpur, the concierge were helpful and frontdesk made me felt that checkin is so effortless. When you arrived at the main entrance, a nice ambiance of serenity and friendliness greeted you. Among the few hotels I've stayed before with nice scent in the air.  The breakfast was scrumptious, although the kitchen was not Halal certified. We opted mostly on vegetarian and seafoods, which still have a good range of selection. Kids were thrilled to be given colouring kits and free scoop of ice cream. Price wise a bit pricey, but then again I think it was the standard price for its class.  The pool on the other hand was a bit small or nothing too fancy for kids toâ¦",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"I had a wonderful experience at The Fullerton Hotel. Amazing location and my room is facing Marina Bay with a balcony. The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting downtown.",10,Oct-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"My family staycation at the Palladian Suite is satisfactory. The staff are commendable and Strait Club privileges are excellent! We dined well at Town Restaurant & Courtyard ; Mr Kumar Duty Mgr at the latter went out of his way to wrap up our staycation with distinction by accommodating to our needs. The SPA was excellent too. An improvement to make is to ensure room amenities prepared for the number of registered adults upon check in. I wasted time requesting for the third of everything (slipper, bath robe & towel, tooth brush etc) for my family of 3 despite the same request made at reservation. I am open to visiting The Fullerton again!",8,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Amazing hotel with amazing service! Checkin was flawless and the room was well appointed. No refreshing needed in the room as everything was neat, clean, and not showing any signs of wear and tear. Mini bar and snacks were great.   For breakfast, the cafe in the lobby was good. No complaints whatsoever ever. If you are looking for old world charm with newer amenities, this is the place to stay.  For guests, two things to consider, there isnât a hotel âgiftâ shop so if you need meds, drinks, snacks, there is a 24 Hr 7-11 less than 10min walk.  Also, I did have a terrible experience at the Spa, but not holding that against the hotel given it is separate. Be very careful when booking any service with the spa. Never again!",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Chandra was very nice and his services were great. Excellent at his job. He offered to call taxis every time be saw us in the lobby and all the other staff had great recommendations as well. Cleaning services are excellent no need to worry.,10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We stayed twice in week in two seperate bookings. Our rooms where renovated and had views out over the bay. Room service was amazing and suited our palates after both flights where delayed.  Our third night was a disaster, due to the airline cancelling our flight. The issue being we had to take the last room that seemed to be available, it was hot and unrenovated on level 4. Sadly the hotel was fully booked due to the Grand Prix lead up. The room was oversized and a window which if you stood on a chair it has a view. We just couldnât resist to take a photo as my husband is â6.4â.  Overall we liked our stay but the last night stay was substandard for the price tag.  The stand out team member was Chandra at the door who helped with our room swap and front door.",8,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Had an excellent stay in at the Fullerton for 3 nights in September, we enjoyed Straits club breakfast afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canapÃ©s! Crystal and Ryan were wonderful and very attentive throughout our stay - we canât wait to come back with family at Easter time next year!",10,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"This was our second stay at the Fullerton Hotel. We love the old world charm of the hotel as well as the location being close to the river with lots of restaurants and raffles MRT station. All of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful making you feel right at home. A special mention must go to Sall around the pool. He always greets you with a smile and ice cold water and loves to have a chat with the guests. He is a real credit to the hotel. We stayed in a heritage room overlooking the marina. It was kept clean with plenty of towels. Maybe they could replenish the soaps etc a bit more regularly.  We ate breakfast in the Town restaurant every morning and although the variety was fantastic the western style food was always cold, except for the freshly made eggs! It didnât matter if you were there at the start of service or a couple of hours in. This is a major issue that needs to be rectified.  We also ate at the seafood buffet one night and it was the same. Quite disappointing for the price you have to pay. The pool area is spectacular and a great way to spend a few hours after sightseeing. Canât wait to return on our next visit to Singapore!â¦",8,Aug-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"It was a pleasant stay with our kids but nothing very memorable. The kids love the bed and bath tub, the tv channels and the breakfast spread like any other hotels. There isn't much activities for kids but this isn't a family friendly hotel to begin with. But our request for a small cake to celebrate their belated birthday wasn't attended to, even after asking about it twice. We learnt from friends that kids usually receive a mini Fullerton Bear during check-in and requested for 1 during check out but was turned down by being ignored by the concierge. It would have been a nice stay for couples but not for family. Probably won't come again.",8,Sep-22,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"On early arrival on a very damp September morning with high expectations we were slightly deflated not to get an immediate early check in but this was tempered by the coffee and cake provided by a very kind staff member. We were allocated our room at 10.30 and had to pay a Â£660 pre authorisation that I felt was a little unreasonable . However that was the downside as the remainder of our stay was memorable. Our room was luxurious and had super views of the Quay and every item one wished for was to hand. The concierge even provided umbrellas. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the whole team worked extremely hard. This is an outstanding hotel and there were niggles such as being told there were no tables available in Jade but to return a couple of hours later (looking much smarter) and were immediately shown to our table. The dinner at Jade, though expensive,  was superb and we enjoyed every mouthful. Niggles aside the comfort and quality were superbâ¦",10,Sep-22,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We loved the service and room at this hotel which is conveniently located to the train. We had a small balcony that overlooked the bay.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),We stayed at the Fullertonâs hotel for 2 nights. They had a staycation deal at the time - 2 nights for the price of 2 so ended up being really good value by Singapore standards.   Location- Great location as itâs right next to the Marina Bay.   Room- I love the room decor. It had the biggest tv ever. The bathroom had one of those smart toilets that does everything for you - all you need to do is sit. Haha.   Service - customer service was great and very responsive.   We didnât have breakfast here so canât comment on food.   Would recommend and stay again if Iâm Singapore.,10,Apr-22,

I want a family package for a connected Heritage room $450 per night to stay 2 nights, but at check out, hotel charged me 2 rooms 2 nights for $1800! During the booking and my stay, hotel didn't explained to me the connected room is a 2 room 2 fees, insisted I stayed 2 rooms and must pay 2 room prices. The staff Ms. Rhea was very unprofessional and not friendly at all, keep on saying it's their policy and I have signed the papers... Even I complained to the director of rooms, Mr Terry Wu still said the they had sent me confirmations and they are nothing wrong with it. The problem is this hotel just want to rip off you and doesn't care the customers. They don't care customer feeling at all. This hotel didn't explain to customers their servicesâ¦",2,Apr-22,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Really enjoyed my stay at The Fullterton - the bed was very comfortable, room service and housekeeping was very good, the gym, pool and sauna were all excellent, and the bathtub was a treat!

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"This is the best hotel we have stayed in Singapore for the past two years. Checking in/out is fuss free, the decorations are pleasing to look at and the room we stayed in is clean and comfortable.

Even though there's no halal food provided by the hotel, we can easily get them from nearby places like Lau Pa Sat, Esplanade and Marina Square, just to name a few.

In room dining staff was also very friendly and sent our request up promptly.  The room was also extremely big and I enjoyed the bathtub inside the room. The best thing about the room would have to be the toilet bowl as it has a seat warmer and it makes the experience enjoyable.   Thank you Fullerton Hotel",10,Apr-22,

Next moment she didnât even check for us and just checked us in to the courtyard room. We asked again and she simply said not available. But when I checked online there were still many heritage rooms available. We asked for parking coupon and she said âyou can only exit once, subsequently itâs payableâ.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We are hesitant to stay at high end properties as we have found that the experience does not always match the hype, however, this is definitely not the case with The Fullerton.  From the moment of arrival until checkout, our stay was simply fantastic.  The Fullerton is well above our pay grade but it was a birthday treat and we managed to get an exceptional rate for a courtyard room which was spacious, very comfortable and quiet. We stayed for four nights of a 9 night trip to Singapore and after day one we were eagerly trying to change our stay to the entire 9 nights but sadly that was not possible. The complimentary history tours the hotel provides were terrific as were the guides, Linda and Thomas. The pool area was a lovely sanctuary and Selikan was a gracious host,  All preâ¦",10,Apr-22,

Booking was seamless and Mira was extremely patient and helpful with her excellent suggestion of esplanade rooms facing the Marina Bay. Check-in was really smooth with Tomoko. We were indeed impressed with the spacious and well appointed esplanade rooms which were very clean and well maintained; and our housekeeper did a great job everyday.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),Stayed for 5 nights in a premier courtyard room. Room was refurbished. Bathroom was huge by Singapore hotel standards. I kept the curtains closed most of the time. I picked the Fullerton because I like hotels that have character. A lot of 5 star hotels in my opinion are soulless and the same. The location was fabulous for the things that interest me. Being so close to the Merlion and waterways was great. The train station is so close as well. The staff that stood out for me were the concierge and front door man. Sharing tips on quickest transportation routes etc. Breakfast was plentiful but I do wish it went to 11am instead of 10:30am.

We called the helpdesk and the plumber came to fix it. Took about 45-60mins.   Spider webs on fixtures.

Had a smooth check in and check out experience, the rooms are large specious and have all the modern amenities The breakfast spread is excellent, the overall service levels are very good. The location of the hotel is excellent overlooking the Singapore river, with walking distance to financial district and Boat quay.

Fullerton Hotel went above and beyond despite having a high occupancy rate. Not only did they allow me to check in early for us to get some rest before getting our make up done. Not only that, I am thankful that Fullerton Hotel even provide us a short limo ride to the restaurant for us to get to our solemnisation as I sprained my ankle and was experiencing great difficulty walking to the restaurant even though it was a short walk. We stayed for 2 nights and for our last night we were given a complimentary upgrade and granted us a late check out! Something that me and my wife are thankful!

Truly The Fullerton Hotel is iconic and filled with history. I never regret booking and staying with The Fullerton Hotel! Their service is exceptional! They truly make you feel welcome. I was made to feel important and distinguished. The hotel is walking distance to the central business district and importantly to Marina Bay Sands and the iconic Merlion.

We stayed at the Collyer Suite and we were granted access to the Straits Club. If you are there look out for Paolo. Paolo service is exceptional. We are impress with his service attitude!

Two usb ports were not working (very important), good thing I had an universal adaptor. Nespresso machine was not working. Room was not quite there were constant construction noises coming from the ceiling possibly above room. Next morning around 10AM room cleaning people kept talking for quite long time I could say about thirty minutes so I could not rest. Also I was charged for using the minibar and refrigerator but I thought my reservation included it. So I double checked my room and it seems like it includes those services so I will have to shoot an email to the customer service. Not a real 5star hotel quality. ",4,18-Jan-20,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Amazing building, location, staff and history!
Rooms and the spa and gym facilities are top notch including the fancy toilets ;) 
The STRAITS CLUB was very efficiently run and service was very friendly. 
The ONLY complaint would be that the hotel claims the gym opens at 7am which is a little late but upon arriving at 6am, there were already people inside and the facilities.  were open. Also a bit better information or signage on the wonderful washrooms, sauna, showers, and steam room available just off the pool area.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Check in took too long even with pre-check-in registration form completed beforehand, waited 45mins at the lobby along with many others. If I compared it to the weekend before when I stayed at Fairmont, check in only took 5 mins with pre-registration, no waiting at all. At the reception, while the person checking me in realized that that day was my birthday, he did wish me happy birthday but that was it. There was nothing else special about my stay. The room assigned was a little strange, once I opened the door, I had to go down 4 steps of stairs carrying my luggage. Ordered room service of 2 item - a noodle and a coke zero, and they got it wrong, gave me coke instead of coke zero, I had to call them then they came again with the coke zero. Overall, it was average stay. Nothing to shout about, no urge to come back again.",6,4-Apr-21,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Overall stay was good, the only hiccup was from the housekeeping team.

Cleanliness was compromised. When being offered to make up the room, I mention that they can clean up at 6pm.
Unfortunately, when I got back at 10.30pm. My room was untouched.

Total disappointment in housekeeping services.

But I would like to compliment Jack, from Concierge Team, and Ravi, from Bellboy service, to provide the housekeeping service on behalf.

Without Jack and Ravi, my room will be in a disaster mode.",6,11-Apr-21,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),I liked the loft suite. Nice big windows and great bay view. What I didn't like was that there were too many light switches. Maybe because it was a big suite.,10,22-Feb-21,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Very clean and staff are polite. Deep soaking pool. Balcony with view of marina bay. Breakfast can be further improved though as it lacks a little variety, tried the vegetarian breakfast too, but still for the price it can be further improved. ",10,14-Feb-21,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Interesting history behind the building.
However due to covid-19's safe distancing, we can't really roam around the hotel without designated time slot. The carpark to hotel was quite a distance away, which make it quite inconvenient for those with kids.",8,25-Oct-20,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"We love the ambience of the hotel. The counter staff doing the check-in and check-out were polite and very efficient. Room service staff who brought items we have requested were also very prompt and helpful.  
Only the temperature-taking staff prior to our checking-in, the female staff asked us to sit down at a table and then forgot about us. After waiting for more than 20 mins, I decided to approach another male staff, only then, our temperature was taken before we could move on to checking-in.
I certainly hope to stay in this hotel again given that the Heritage Room is spacious, very clean and well-maintained.  Breakfast was sumptious and the Courtyard cafe's staff were also helpful.",10,26-Nov-20,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean),"Went for a night staycation at Fullerton Hotel. Booked the Quay room with river view. Was given room 267. Sadly this was the older room that was not renovated. 

Furnitures are dated, and as room was at the corner of the 2nd floor so there wasn't really a good view of anything as it is not high enough. Disappointing for the price I paid.

Room was near the pool and was woken up by kids playing in pool the next morning. 

Water heater seem to be not functioning well. Even the in room jacuzzi has faulty jets that doesn't works. 

The balcony area is linked to the others room as well, there are some workers changing the lights above the balcony area and they left bits of rubbish and tissue papers after they are done.

Just to add, don't expect to charge your phones or gadget by the bed side as there are no power or USB points by he bed.

Overall I am very underwhelmed by the experience. Do not know how it manage to get average 9.4 ratings for a five star heritage hotel in Singapore.",6,1-Feb-21,

Helpful reception staff and a charming heritage building in a street full of similar buildings. We expected the room to be small but it was big enough for our needs. We had asked for a balcony room so at least we had windows but it was usually too hot to want to be outside.

There is just about space to make a cup of tea.The bathroom was basic, cleaning not bad but a bit rough round the edges, which may be more a case of needing a refresh.

The Scarlet Singapore,"The hotel was in an ideal situation near to Chinatown. Walkable to all sights. Pleanty of restaurants near by. The rooms are small so would recommend paying to have a balcony.

Scarlet did not disappoint.  A lovely warm welcome (even at midnight) and a beautiful room. I decided to kick my trip off in style and selected an elevated Executive room (237). The room was immaculate. Clean and very comfortable. Moreover, plenty of room to move and such attentive staff to look after you, I was quite at ease from the first moment. Everyone was helpful with local tips and things to see and do. It was my first time in Singapore and find I am returning there for a birthday in July.

So we were booked in a room with one queen size bed. I am not a quiet sleeper so it will be a problem with my colleague. The hotel manager, Leslie was kind enough to offer us to change our room if there is an available one, unfortunately, all the rooms were booked. But Leslie can work wonders and luckily he found a room with two beds and not only that, iit was a suite. This make our stay more memorable and I highly recommend the Scarlet hotel Singapore for your next visit to Singapore. It is also near the Maxell food center, yummy Sinagaporean food.",10,Apr-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Great location if wanting to explore Chinatown.  Staff welcoming, helpful and informative.  Rooms small and in our case the decor was a little tired.  Bed hard but comfortable if not a little small for people of above average height.  Shower strong and lots of room but no fan and damp patches on the ceiling.  My main concern was what might happen if there was a fire.  The hotel is made up of old terraced houses that have been knocked through to make a hotel.  A single corridor runs through the buildings and in the event of a fire it would act like a wind tunnel.  We were on the third floor and while there was adequate emergency stairs you couldnât help but feel it would be hard to evacuate in the early hours should that potential wind tunnel fan the flames in an old building. â¦",6,Apr-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,"I recently stayed in an Executive Room at The Scarlet. Overall, the stay was up to standard - the room and decor was good and the housekeeping staff in particular were very warm and friendly. Big plus was the hotel having Handy phones for guest use while traveling around Singapore.

Easy access to not one but about 4 different MRT stations.",8,Mar-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,"This hotel has been setup by restoring old Shop Front houses in the Chinatown area, and has been surperbly done on all accounts. Each room is a different size and has been individually furnished to a very comfortable standard whilst remaining quirky. The reception area is a combination of luxury meets Alice in Wonderland, and is a delight to see with the way it has been decorated. Chinatownâs top streets are footsteps away, whilst the hotel is on a quiet street. The hotel is part of the Luxe Boutique Hotel Group and the staff are very friendly also and impeccably dressed. It is very well priced and we would definately stay here in the future.",10,Apr-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,Whilst not the cheapest place to stay its position is excellent - 5mins from China town and with very helpful staff We stayed in a premier room on the ground floor - very spacious but only one window too high to see through Robes and slippers provided Large bathroom too with full range of toiletries Would go back,8,Jan-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"This is the honeymoon of me and my wife. Our first time staying in Singapore. My sister had been in this hotel so she choose this hotel for us. The room is nice and the location is also good. Good traffic! And especially Leslie, the guy who works in the hotel, as you got anything question about Singapore then you can ask him, he will tell you anything he knows. Feels like you are his friend, that he is not just doing his job. What is good service? I think I can have it in the scarlet.",10,Apr-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,"I have stayed at several boutique hotels in Singapore and this one was by far the best.  It is located right next to Chinatown, Maxwell Food Court, and Club Street so there are lots of sightseeing and food choices.  I was working in the CBD and it was a very quick 10 minute door-to-door walk to work.  The hotel itself was very charming and the rooms were very well appointed--clean, large, open, and tasteful.  The bed was very comfortable as well.  The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating and took care of all my needs immediately.  I stayed there two weeks and was sorry to leave.  Anyone coming to Sg should check this place out as you can't beat it!!",10,Jan-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Hi , check in hotel ,we explained it was my partners 50th and they gave us upgrade on our room free of charge, rooms were styled beautifully ,  with attention to detail for everything , great location in China town , used the Jacuzzi at the end of day , also you can use this area on your last day once you have checked out to get showered and changed   before going to airport ",10,Feb-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,"This hotel took my booking without warning that I was booking over a public holiday during which the hotel would be hardly functioning.   When I arrived, they took my credit card to block for incidentals. However, it then transpired that the restaurant was not open for the whole of my stay, there was no room service and the only possibility of spending money on âincidentalsâ was two cans of coke in the fridge!  Not even water was provided. The room was small and very tired. Further, it then transpired that not only all the shops were closed but also all the Chinese restaurants and, since the hotel is located in Chinatown, that meant all the nearby restaurants.

The Scarlet Singapore,"The best point about this hotel is itâs location. It is surrounded by great bars, restaurants and easy walking to many attractions - Maxwell hawker centre, Chinatown, Marina bay, shopping malls and more.   Unfortunately the hotel was a let down in a few areas.   1. Room size, we were upgraded which was lovely. Unfortunately the executive room we were given was tiny. Too small for two people. As we were traveling for three weeks we had two cases and carry bags. There was just no room to store things. I completely get that the hotel is converted from shops and the size comes from this. With that in mind I would recommend to single travellers.   2. Avoid breakfast. We had it included in our booking. There is not a good selection. Both times we had breakfast it was only us and oneâ¦",6,Mar-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We stayed at your hotel for 3 days.was very disappointed to tell the truth.The pictures of this hotel does not live up to expectations.Rooms need a good clean dident want to stay in the room for any longer than needed. Good location  and staff nice that's  the to stars.This place needs a good lick of paint very tired.,4,Mar-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I loved everything about this hotel but the bed. It was SO hard, and I slept terribly because of this. I did inform staff after our first night and they kindly put an underlay on the bed, but it made only a slight difference.  If you have any type of back issues, or canât manage an extremely firm mattress, then donât stay here. That said, the location is amazing, itâs close to Chinatown main streets. The spa is nice, and the decor is very lush. Staff were friendly and helpful. I want to rate this hotel higher but I canât due to the lack of sleep! ",6,Mar-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,"We stayed 4 nights at the Scarlet Singapore hotel. We were in room 305, which had a balcony overlooking a street and a parking lot across the street. Our door opened out to an open-air walkway above the jacuzzi.  The small room had a king bed, A/C, TV, electronic safe, a small fridge with a few sodas in it, a coffee maker, a desk and chair (the only chair in the room), 2 chairs and a small table on the balcony.A free mobile phone was provided in the room. Luggage space was a bit of a problem.  There was a nice rooftop bar. And the service from the employees in the lobby was terrific. They were always eager to provide information to answer our questions, or help with telephoning chores. We enjoyed the jacuzzi one night, using the fire escape to go down to it, and the elevator forâ¦",8,Jan-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The airport taxi driver had no idea where it was, but I did â in Erskine Road, just off South Bridge Road, in Chinatown. The entrance suggests either a casino or an up-market escorted karaoke bar â gold, black sparkling granite, crimson.  The street level front of the hotel comprises the original (more or less) shophouses, which means that the ground-floor rooms lack any daylight (there is a tiny skylight, perhaps to satisfy some technical regulation, but it admits neither light nor sky).  This is useful if, as I was, you are keen to readjust your body clock to some other time-zone. Otherwise it is a bit oppressive.  The room was perfectly well-appointed and decorated in a traditional, if slightly tired,  kind of way, with a good-sized bathroom, and the bed was comfortable. â¦",6,Feb-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The pictures look more inviting than the real thing. We generally look for smaller boutique hotels but this one let us down compared to others weâve stayed in in Asia   The outside still has the old fashioned look but inside was dark with teeny tiny rooms. Nice colours & all, just small & claustrophobic. We did have a teeny balcony but fit only one person at a time.  The lobby & all the staff we encountered were very nice & the position is very handy to Maxwell Hawker Centre & Chinatown.  The best thing we found though was a little bar (just up to the corner & left down to a blue building) on the roof & behind Scarlet.  It was so cute with the best cocktails made with flavoured teas. Superb!! Only one other thing to mention too is the outstanding brekky at this hotel. So goodâ¦",8,Mar-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I called them few hours before checking in to decorate the room for birthday & anniversary. Diane, if I get the name correctly, was really sweet. She helped us to decorate the room, gave us free wine and chocolates. Not only that, also gave us late check out.   Their gym is 24 hours and they have jacuzzi too! You should check it out. We got the premium room and it is quite spacious, with bathtub, complimentary bar and smart tv!   I really enjoyed my stay here. Thank you so much. The service is better than 5 star hotels xx",10,Feb-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Perfect location, clean, friendly service, cute decor. The rooms and beds were comfy. The bathrooms are modern and spacious. Complimentary slippers are a nice touch. They offer a FREE cell phone, you can make unlimited local and long distance calls, gps and discounts on activities. Our flight arrived early and the front desk staff held our bags and gave us access to the pool area so we could take a shower and relax. Very good customer service and this hotel is on a historical register too. The windows in our room were small but you can pay more for a balcony. Reasonably priced, I would stay here again and highly recommend The Scarlet.",10,Mar-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I saw this boutique hotel being highly recommended on Trip Advisor. So I decided to try it with my bf for a 1 night stay. The hotel seems very sophisticated, with beautiful furnitures. Upon closer look, it is not very well maintained.  Patches of paint touch up was clearly evident. The room has quite abit of things to repair/maintain as shown in the pictures below. The jacuzzi is the only highlight of the room. But the jacuzzi is outdoors and on the right side there is some construction works going on for 24/7. Lucky the yard glass door is sound proof so it doesn't affect our sleep. Overall, I would give it a 3.5/5. I won't come back again as this amount of money I can stay at MBS room or other higher end hotel.   ",6,Feb-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We booked the Scarlet due to its very good TripAdvisor reviews and we werenât disappointed.  Singapore is an expensive city but I thought it was very reasonably priced. The rooms are comfortable and well finished and the staff are extremely friendly.  Location is good in the heart of busy Chinatown with Maxwell Road hawker market literally right opposite the hotel. Itâs about 20/25 minute (easy) walk to the Marina Bay and there is an MRT station less than 5 mins away (Chinatown). There is a small gym which we used a couple of times. Our flight was very late and when we went back to collect our bags we were given the opportunity to shower and freshen up which was really appreciated.

Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Calling a taxi usually only takes 2-5 minutes. A bit of a walk away from the MRT train station; so recommend a taxi if you have large luggage.  Very cool they converted old store fronts into hotel rooms. Some disagreed with this, but I liked it.  AC works amazing! and fridge in room actually works! unlike other hotels we've been to in Singapore at budget prices.

The Scarlet Singapore,There is construction work directly opposite the hotel that goes on throughout the night. The management did NOT inform me of this when booking. I cannot sleep. Sound insulation is zero.  YOU NEED TO INFORM PEOPLE IN ADVANCE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP.  My actual room is disappointingly small. Staff are very nice but nothing can make up for putting guests in a room with the full knowledge that sleep will be impossible. Look at the photos. The time is clear and itâs unacceptable. ,2,Mar-19,

I stayed in a suite called Splendor and it was really nice although its a little odd shaped but you need to remember this is a shop house structure! The bathroom was huge with a jacuzzi function bathtub and a separate rain shower. As this is a boutique hotel, I enjoyed the room with complimentary minibar of chips and drinks as well and some traditional biscuits for my wedding anniversary!

This was at the back of the hotel, so we didn't hear any construction noises. It was very comfortable, with good air conditioning and a nice big shower in the bathroom. The lounge areas were lavishly decorated and comfortable too. A fabulous location, near Chinatown, for fabulous street food, with three different metro stations to choose from.

We stayed for 3 nights as we were flying from London to Bali but wanted to experience Singapore and the Scarlet was amazing.  The decor is stunning, loads of rich colours like deep red and smooth dark purple, it felt very luxurious and plush!  We stayed in a double deluxe room and it was perfect, massive bed with a big bathroom and plenty of room for our luggage.  There is also a rooftop jacuzzi which has a beautiful view of the city! The breakfast was nice but didnât have much choice for vegans unfortunately, but plenty of food for vegetarians and meat eaters.

It's perfect if you want to have a night exploring the great pubs, bars, restaurants, and street food in Singapore.  The hotel itself is alright... lots of character, comfy bed, big room, good free wifi, mini fridge, clean, and big bathroom. Lovely greeting with a glass of guava juice, and staff were lovely.  However we had a few issues. Firstly, the room was quite dungeon-like as it only had a few small windows up high near the ceiling. We hadn't known we were paying for a semi-underground room. Secondly, the room was FREEZING (they'd blasted the aircon as cold as it'd go) and even when weâ¦",8,Mar-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,Love this place.  Fantastic location in the heart of Chinatown.  Friendly people at the hotel but mostly it is just full of charm and cheeky character. I am not sure what the building used to be but it now has a quite fun and cheeky feel to it... like a range of Boudoirs (all done very tastefully). I thought it was reasonably priced.  We arrived very early around 9 pm but they were very accomodating and allowed us access to our room straight away which made a massive difference to our day.  Would certainly stay here again.,10,Mar-19,

The Scarlet Singapore,"Worst bed Iâve ever slept on. My wife and I suffered severe back pain and spasms on our first night. When checking out the next day, the attempts to fix this issue included being upgraded to a room with a coffee machine, or having a duvet put on the bed. Not acceptable.  Also, the level of noise from nearby traffic at night was very loud.  Finally, even though the room was booked directly with the hotel, they would not assist with any form of refund so we lost $2000 when we had to leave and book another hotel.  Very disappointing.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Great location and something different if used to larger properties, disappointed that although I booked and paid for 4 premier rooms, I was advised at check-in that mini bar was not included in rate.

Right now it feels a bit lost, there has clearly been refurbishment and yet there seems to have been slightly less attention to design and detail and even in the way the windows have been haphazardly nailed shut in the room I stayed in...not quite the same Scarlet as I loved in my previous visits.

The Scarlet Singapore,We stayed at the scarlet and the staff were amazing. The topped the mini bar up (very well!) both nights we stayed and it was complimentary as we booked the better room so I recommend doing so. Location is amazing I will 100% stay there again.   We only stoped over for 2 nights so the no pool didnât bother us at all as the air con is really good so we were comfy.  Ayub was a star and I hope he stays there till my next visit!,10,Jun-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I'm in SG for work but want to explore the old town in my spare time. The Scarlet is the perfect spot in the middle of ""old town,"" within walking distance of the office towers and with tons of bars, restaurants and hawker stands in the vicinity.   Service is spectacular, and the decor is quaint and unique -- makes me think of nice Parisian hotels. There's definitely a bohemian vibe to this place.   And on top of that it's very affordable!",10,Jun-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,It was great experience at The Scarlet Hotel Singapore especially the hospitality of their staff during my stay. To be specific Mr.Haziq was really kind & coordinating during my stay there. He is always ready to go extra mile to give best service.,8,May-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Excellent hotel and customer service, would especially like to commend Ayub for the pleasant experience.  Love the interior and theme of the hotel as well and great location!  Bath salts and a scrubbing sponge were provided as toiletries for a comfortable bath soak. Complimentary wine for the suite room which shows they go the extra mile for guests.   Overall a lovely experience and love everything about this hotel. My favourite place to book for a chill weekend.  Thank you, I will definitely be back.",10,Jun-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,"Situated in a quiet nook in the City Centre, the Scarlet is a delightful boutique hotel.   The staff are very friendly and service-oriented and prompt to meet requests like extra bottles of water.  In particular, I would single out Faiz for special kudos for his attention to detail and exceeding my expectations in his service.  It didn't hurt that he has a great smile too.",10,May-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Our stay at the Scarlt was much better than expected! The rooms are very clean and equipped with a good AC. The minibar is free of charge, and refilled every day! A special thank to Faizz who helped us during our stay, and planned a trip to the natural reserves!",10,May-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I stayed at this property for the first time in over 5 years and was kind of shocked to find that very little had changed in that time.  Firstly the positives, it oozes charm, character and is kind of funky. Location is great for the various restaurants and bars that are everywhere. If you want something different from the typical corporate style hotel that caters for business travellers, The Scarlet makes a nice change. However, its now getting quite tired, which is why I was surprised there didnt appear to be any type of recent upgrade or renovation. I stayed in one of the suites, and at over $500/night including taxes, there's just no way Id be able to justify that again. The room was relatively small with not a lot of cupboard space, although I loved having a nice balcony.â¦",8,Apr-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Just a quick note to acknowledge Faizz and his amazing customer service at 1am on a public holiday weekend.  My girlfriend and I decided at last-minute to stay at a nearby hotel, after drinking a little too much at one of our favourite bars in the local area.  Faizz had to give us sad news that The Scarlet was fully booked and were unable to accommodate us that evening.  However, being The Amazing Faizz, he very kindly offered to search other local hotels that could possibly accommodate us at 1am. We eventually found one for a reasonable price and he helped secure the room with an online booking.  On top of this, he also helped to book a taxi, which is an almost impossible task on the public holiday weekend.   So, thank you so much again Faizz for helping a drunk couple with aâ¦",10,Apr-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,The suite room was beautiful ! Room was clean and housekeeping was friendly despite many request.   The check in was fast and the staff was very friendly.    Thank you Faiz for taking care of us during our stay. You literally customised your service to cater to our needs.   Best Service award should go to this hotel ! Good job !,10,Apr-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I had a birthday celebration here with my friends. Before I choose this hotel, I was looking through the reviews on TripAdvisor and notice the Staff name Faizz name mention by many guest . So we decided to call the hotel and make reservations by Faizz.   We booked the Suite. Due to our busy schedule,  Faizz offered to give us a video call suite tour so that we can choose the best suite.   He recommended the Swank as it is his personal favourite and we went for it   The room was huge and  come with a separated bed room and living room. I love the balcony the most.   Faizz was very helpful and even decorated the room out of good will matches to our Theme which is ""Kinky""   Thank you so much Scarlet Hotel for hosting us . If the hotel's owners is reading this , kindly help us toâ¦",10,Apr-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,I am truly amazed and delighted upon stepping into the room with that by all the deco and the layout of the room.  A friend invited us for his birthday and the hotel stuff actually took a lot of effort putting into the various decorations like mask sexy aprons and a lot of stuff. We actually had an enjoyable time at hotel and definitely looking forward to try the other rooms being offered.  Would like to thank Qistina and her team for putting a lot of effort and fun decoration to the room.   Thank you,10,Apr-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,Great location in Chinatown. Quaint lowrise building om a quiet side street. Comfy beds  fantastic service from the staff. Would gladly stay again on my next trip to Singapore! Looking forward to the jacuzzi!,10,Jun-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Wow weâve just returned from 10 nights at the Scarlet. I can honestly say the choice of the Scarlet made our holiday, from the really warm welcome to the beautiful room with the comfiest bed ever the complimentary mini bar re stocked daily we thought it couldnât be any better but Diana Joscelyn and Faizz the reception staff were amazing the most friendly helpful hotel staff we have ever come across nothing was too much trouble from recommending places to visit to places to eat and just the welcoming smiles on your return after long hot days sightseeing. A lovely hotel in a fantastic location close to transport and good places to eat in Chinatown far better than a  large corporate hotel in a tower block. Weâll definitely be back x",10,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We were greeted by Nana, nite desk professional, with open arms, a cold towel and easy check in after 24 hours of travel.  Room, bed, bath and amenities were lovely.  Enjoyed location near Chinatown and great food stands.  On quiet street.  Entire staff was warm, friendly, helpful and professional.  We received near Ritz service with this team.   We will return to the Scarlet.",10,Dec-18,
The Scarlet Singapore,Very cute and clean hotel right in China town. Awesome service! Only 30 min from the airport away and 10 minutes to the marina bay sand and also Singapore hanging gardens.   10/10 can recommend to friends and family,10,Jun-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We were a family of 5 so needed 3 separate rooms but it still worked out cheaper than almost all other central hotels in Singapore.   Style/Decor - our teenage kinds loved the rather sultry decor with red corridors and suggestive messaging.  Also had a great, popular rooftop bar. Location - positioned in a lovely redeveloped arcade of shops, perfect for exploring Chinatown and adjoining central areas. We were able to access hundreds of bars and restaurants within a few minutes.  Only downside was some night time noise from nearby bars. Service - very friendly and efficient reception service. Rooms - quite small and a bit tired. Big difference in size of bathrooms so suggest a request for larger one. No natural light in any of the rooms we had although indirect light via hiddenâ¦",8,Aug-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,The hotel is located right across the road from the Maxwell food centre and within a few minutes walk of two other food/hawker centres so is perfectly placed to cater for any catering requirements whilst on your visit. The hotel itself is deceptively large but hidden from sight. The rooms are finished to a very good standard with complementary bar and a bottle of wine. The staff were fantastic as they helped us through a major panic on arrival with a missing passport but they quickly helped resolve the problem with a quick call to the taxi company. Highly recommended as a perfect base from which to explore.,10,Aug-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Very enjoyable stay at The Scarlet, the staff could not do enough for you and the rooms are lovely and clean. Beds comfortable, so are the pillows and the towels nice and fluffy. Mini bar included in the room rate which was a nice bonus. Didnât eat or drink at the hotel but it has a nice roof top bar. Umbrella and safe in the room which is always welcome. Loved staying in China town and the Scarlet was a great location, would definitely stay here again.",10,Aug-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Located on a quiet street in Chinatown, this 1920 art deco building has every amenity you would ever need.  Our room was clean and neat (love those pillows and comfy king bed).  Staff was very friendly  and helpful navigating the sights and sounds of Singapore.",8,Aug-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Highly recommend the Scarlet. It's in a great quiet location in China town, right next to the Maxwell food market. Staff are very friendly and cannot do enough for you. Special thanks to Faizz who helped return our lost luggage from the airport.  The rooms are very comfortable and the complimentary mini bar is a great bonus. ",10,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The front desk and housekeeping were very friendly and helpful.   Near the MRT and the chinatown night markets where you can eat your heart out :)   There is also a shower room if you need to freshen up after checking out, should you wish to go sightseeing before your flight  Would definitely stay again!",10,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,I was supposed to stay here for 14 nights for a business trip. I left after 5 (I couldnt cancel these 5 nights). Pros: - location is great - I stayed in the premium king and the room was big  Cons: - It wasn't cleaned! I had hairs both in the sink and in the towel.  - Costumer service: when I told this to the front desk they only came to clean the next day and didn't think this was a big deal. - the bed was bumpy which means that your knees are really high which caused a back pain. - noisy! You hear everything- outside parties and next door rooms.  I wouldn't stay here again.,4,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Amazing boutique hotel.. great service and awesome room. What makes this place amazing is people who work in the Hotel like Puvan.   Puvan not only helped with my luggage, made sure I donât forget anything and gave me a coffee on way to the airport. Most go!",10,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Amazing customer services, hotel was strategically located (near a lot of interesting restaurant and only 1 minute walk to hawkers with lots of amazing food), room was kept in pristine condition, amnesties were always refilled without asking.

The Scarlet Singapore,"I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received at The Scarlet Hotel from 11 September 2022 to 12 September 2022.  Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive and kind especially FAIZZ. Me and my husband had a wonderful one night staycation with a free upgrade and complimentary wine to celebrate my husbandâs 51st birthday. My husband was mesmerized by the hotel roomâs interior design, and the way everything had been decorated. I have recommended The Scarlet Hotel to all of my colleagues, friends and family.  I felt really comfortable during the stay, and your services are compliment worthy for sure. I am a woman who thinks that all the good things should be appreciated.  Thank you again for such outstanding service. Keepâ¦",10,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"My husband and I are usually the type to AirBnB but we planned a trip more last minute and found that hotel prices were somewhat comparable to  homestays.   We were thoroughly blown away by the hospitality and do not regret booking at the Scarlet in any way. From a twilight check in to a late checkout, the hotel was incredibly accommodating and we felt we had every creature comfort. The washroom was unimaginably clean and we had acclimation pains (ie: jet lag, coverter problems) and the hotel was perfectly situated to be a quick ride away to rest and help us if we needed anything.  Fiazz and the staff were always so cheerful and incredibly kind - you wonât regret staying in such a historic building!",10,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Perfectly located in the heart of Chinatown, this quaint little hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff (Thank you Thiru and all the front desk staff without exception!) are incredibly helpful.

The staff in the hotel cannot be more welcoming or helpful and do all they can to ensure your stay is comfortable and hassle free;my father had lost his mobile phone on arrival at changi,nothing to do with the hotel but they couldnt do enough to help him retrieve it my room was lovely,with a vast bed,desk and chair,great en suite and plenty storage space.theres a valuables safe and a mini bar fridge which is free and replenished daily,as are snacks and coffee/tea.also included are slippers,hairdryer and,if needed,an umbrella. the rooms and public areas are,of course,air conditioned. on departure day they were happy to store luggage and also gave use of a shower room prior to our departure to the airport thoroughly recommendedâ¦",10,Sep-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,"The Scarlet Hotel promises so much from its website and when you walk into the hotel you feel that it is going to live up to it. First impressions are positive, the lobby is done nicely and it feels like it will be a nice boutique hotel.   We booked the Executive with Balcony and first impressions of the room were disappointing. The room is much smaller than indicated in the picture and the balcony faced a multi storey car park so forget sitting on the balcony and relaxing or in fact even being able to leave the curtains open as itâs a full view into the room.   The bed is comfortable and the pillows thankfully not too soft. The shower is okayâ¦ the shower head is a bit low for me (Iâm 188cms) but itâs got a lot of pressure.   Overall the room is nothing special - I donât know why it is labelled as âExecutiveâ as it doesnât feel any different to the standard room that it her people we are travelling with are staying in.  One good thing is that the mini bar is complimentary, although I think that is the case for all rooms, so again, nothing differentiating this as âExecutiveâ.   Letâs move onto the noise. We stayed a Saturday and Sunday night and the pumping club music is clearly audible. While I accept the area that I am staying in, I donât expect the room to have such poor sound insulation that I could be in the club itself.   The location of the hotel is otherwise good. The Maxwell Food Centre is right next door so you can get your fill of local food which is great. It is an easy walk to Chinatown and MRT.   The only reason I gave this hotel 3 instead of 2 is because of the staff who have all been pleasant and very helpful, especially the reception staff.   I think the hotel promises a lot but doesnât quite deliver. There are definitely better options close by that would be a better choice.â¦",6,Sep-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Arrived a day late after 2 sleepless nights. Checkin was quick and efficient. Shortly after my arrival i discovered my phone was missing and was sure I had left it at Changi immigration. Staff immediately helped, found the appropriate online site and filled in a lost property report for me. 3 days later, I was reunited with my phone. My stay was for 13 nights, room was fine, free mini bar was beneficial and invariably all staff inc cleaning staff were friendly and welcoming. I would certainly recommend in the highest possible way. Roderick MacDonald Scotland",10,Sep-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,My partner and I just spent the long weekend at the Scarlet Hotel in Chinatown and it far exceeded our expectations. We loved the interior and the location was perfect. Right beside Maxwell Food Centre where we had some of the best food of our trip and close to all the main streets and bars in Chinatown. We would definitely stay again and only wish weâd had a bit more time this time! Also the staff were extremely accommodating when we asked for late check out. Overall I would highly recommend.,10,Jun-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,Had a wonderful stay at The Scarlet Hotel. All staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help. They were able to accommodate both an early check-in and late check-out for me which really made a difference and was much appreciated.

Hotel was reasonably priced and I would not hesitate to return on future trips to Singapore.,10,Aug-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,"The staff were A1, nothing was a problem- great friendly personal service, it is lovely to return at the end of the day and be greeted by name as you pass through the foyer . In particular would like to commend Nabila on her exemplary manner and care, we were aware she worked extremely long hours and the smile never left her face- it was a pleasure to know her.  The location was brilliant, so convenient to the MRT and when the Maxwell Rd MRT opens it will be a 2 minute walk, restaurants ,bars and great shopping are within a stones throw and the most delicious french bakery just below the hotel ( that will deliver pastries to your room) . The hotel is well appointed, quirky and a little bit bonkers in design, this is NOT your mainstream big international chain hotelâ¦.fortunately!â¦",10,Jun-22,

The room was nice and enough for my needs as a solo traveller, and sleep quality was good. The complimentary minibar (including a bottle of red wine!) was generous.

The location of the hotel is good, next to Chinatown and a few metres away from numerous restaurants and bars. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",8,Jul-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Of all the Singapore hotels I've stayed in, big and small, the Scarlet is my favourite. Located in an old Chinatown shophouse it meanders along the rooftops of adjoining properties. Rooms are smallish, some with skylights - but you're not here for the view. Clean, comfortable, stylishly fitted, beds are big, pillows plumped, showers hot and strong. You're a few minutes from the Maxwell Street Hawker Market for your morning juices and fruit, and lunchtime chicken rice. In the evening the whole area comes alive with bars an restaurants. It's a good place, and base to explore the rest of Singapore. Scarlet's staff are upbeat, friendly, helpful. We'll be back.",10,May-22,

We booked our room 2.5yr ago and due to SOP have been unable to stay. The Scarlet honoured our booking last week and upgraded us to The Swank Suite which was super cute with a lovely balcony and very generous free mini bar.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Scarlet is in an amazing location bordering Chinatown and via a secret little shortcut via Ang Siang Hill, you will reach an entire new street full of bars, restaurants and the ever famous maxwell foodcourt.  The hotel itself is a collection of shop-houses housing a bakery, ice cream parlour and Italian restaurant whereby breakfast is situated. I had a free mini-bar and a bottle of wine.   Diana at the check-in counter is just amazing and so is Nabila. Both are friendly and ever helpful (not to mention cheerful). The only issue i had is with room service as it never seems to arrive but it didn't matter much. If you're not looking for facilities and something boutique, clean and modern, this is your place! I look forward to visiting them again.",10,Jul-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,"Wonderful service by all the front desk. Special shout out to Faizz who's so thoughful and helpful. I did not mention about my birthday this month which had passed but he took note and prepared birthday chocolates and a birthday card for me. That was really top service gesture and fully appreciated. Stay was great, hotel is clean and quiet. Fully recharged :)",10,Feb-22,
The Scarlet Singapore,Really nice decor and bed was very comfortable. Location was good with lots of choices around. Will recommend to others. Offered late check out due to later check in as room was not ready. Small hotel but a comfortable size bathroom and bed,10,Jan-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The hotel is in a row of converted shop houses and could not be in a better position, just a couple of minutes walk into Chinatown where you can get the underground or buses. It is also an easy walk to many of the main attractions including Clarke Quay, Raffles and Marina Bay. The public areas of the hotel are first class and a little unusual however the room was one of the smallest I have ever stayed in. Having said that it was well equipped with just about everything you would want for a short business or leisure stay. Breakfast was a very limited choice but was freshly prepared and very enjoyable. On the last day of our stay it was great to be able to go back to the hotel after a hot day exploring the city to have a hot shower before going off to the airport.",8,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We  booked our room at the Scarlet after our Air B'nB had some complications and we're glad we did. We didn't arrive until after midnight (nearly 3:00am) and were greeted by two ice cold flutes of juice which was quite refreshing after our long flight. When we woke up we were surprised to see how close we were to Chinatown and there was a Hawker Center right around the corner. The Chinatown subway stop was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Would highly recommend and would stay there again in a heartbeat.,10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,Hotel was convenient for location to areas that I wanted to visit. The guest services were extremely helpful and the staff was very knowledgeable in providing information on the city. I would definitely stay at the Scarlet again for future trips.,8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The Scarlet Singapore is my first choice to recommend in Singapore.It has a great location.Very close to subway station, many restaurants and cafes. Our room was not so spacious but very comfortable and elegant. Special thanks to the manager and her staff. Very good hotel.",10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,My husband and I stopped in Singapore for one night on our way to Europe but in hindsight should not have bothered as we didnât get much sleep in the hotel anyway. On first appearances the hotel reception was quite nice but the room was like a dungeon with no windows and so tiny I had about 35cm between the bed and wall. The bed cover was so small it didnât cover the bed and the pillows and bed were rock hard and the sink clogged up in the bathroom. Terrible experience!,2,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Booked a large room (forgot category).  AC was too strong, so I off it but there was still freezing cold.  No drama but their blanket was very thin and I was actually cold.   Main issue was that my room was on a street level and  since the area is full of bars, it was very noisy with drunk people shouting, fighting, breaking bottles etc.   Good service . Staff was always smiling and friendly which in Singapore is not common.",6,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"My husband and I stayed at The Scarlet for 5 nights during our trip to Singapore. Check in was quick and the staff explained all of the amenities with an added welcome drink. We were in a standard double room which was small but clean and had everything we needed. Location is great, right across the road from a hawker centre, turn right you head in to china town and turn left for club street. For us it was a great base for getting out to explore Singapore. We had a late flight on the day of our check out but we were able to store our bags and use the shower facilities which was great as we could still do some last minute site seeing. A friendly, clean boutique hotel in a good location.",8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Very nice hotel!!!  Situated nearby Chinatown, between Club street and delicious local food corner. Clean and comfortable rooms, helpful staff. Truly recommended  for longer and short stay in Singapore!",10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"If you want a one size fits all, multinational cookie cutter hotel experience then this is not the hotel for you. But if you want to experience the heart and soul of Singapore, the you really should consider staying at the Scarlet. Set in the heart of Singapore, the hotel is literally adjacent to vibrant trendy restaurants and bars, frequented by Singaporeâs young and affluent. Meanwhile, cross Erskine Street and youâll find yourself at the Maxwell Street mall, the heart of Singaporeâs famous street food culture. And at the other end of Erskine Street is Chinatown with its bustling markets. But that is just the location. The staff and management of the hotel are unbelievably friendly and helpful. You donât just feel at home, you feel part of the family. They really go out ofâ¦",10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,My sister and I stayed for three nights in this gorgeous boutique hotel right beside Chinatown.  Staff are so helpful and made us feel very welcome.  It was my birthday during the stay and they surprised me with chocolates and a birthday card.  Room was very clean and a good size.  Hotel has two great restaurants also. Our only criticism was the location of our room near the neighbouring 7/11 store and street was very noisy in the night.  If we stayed again would request a different part of hotel.,8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Small hotel in the middle of Chinatown, perfect place for any activities, a lot of opportunityâs around that hotel. Breakfast from my point of view to expensive but OK. Rooms good, bed perfect also for me 190cm tall. Service very friendly and nice too. Next time again here. Roof bar and restaurant are ok. Thanks for the service. ",8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,The scarlet is just a pleasure to stay we arrived off a 13 hour flight early in the morning  check in wasnât u til 2pm and they got us checked in straight away to a lovey room with balcony . The staff are nothing but amazing  so helpful and kind and looked after our needs endlessly. The hotel is prefect. In every way massive thankyou to Rozie  for all your help and looking after us so well You where truely wonderful . We will definitely be back. Xxx,10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I was in Singapore for a night and wanted to book a hotel experience instead of just a 'normal' hotel. I booked The Scarlet and when I checked in Rozie from the front desk team was extremely friendly and welcoming and even upgraded my booking from the standard room to The Passion Suite (the hotel's best room), I even got my own Jacuzzi on the balcony where I sipped a glass of wine under the moonlight. It was such a great room, very boudoir sexy, and I loved my night there. Super friendly staff and I even had a long conversation with the front desk staff the morning I left.  Highly recommend booking in with The Scarlet if you are looking for an 'out of the ordinary' experience in Singapore. Slept like a baby in the bed, had a beautiful hot rain style shower and of course lappedâ¦",10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We used to frequent Casa Tartufo (within the hotel premises) when we lived in Singapore and I was intrigued by the hotel. Now as a visitor, I thought I would try The Scarlet for a change instead of going for the usual big hotel names, particularly as I like its location.  We stayed 2x within a span of a week as we went for a short trip in between. I booked the Executive Room for both bookings except the 2nd stay had the balcony.  The rooms are small but I expected that. What I didnât expect was how the room with the balcony is actually much smaller inside.  It costs more but itâs not worth it unless you really plan to spend a lot of time on the balcony where the view is not even nice. With the balcony, theyâve compromised on the room space.  The room designs are okay although itâ¦",6,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,Due to severe delays from London Heathrow and a diversion to Bangkok we arrived at the Scarlett Hotel very late in the early hours of the morning.  Exhausted and grumpy we were greeted with smiles and help with our luggage. The hotel is clean and comfortable and in a good location but it is the staff that makes it special. Professional and friendly from the receptionists to the porters and concierge they made our brief visit very enjoyable and we will definitely like to return and stay longer next time.,10,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Stayed at The Scarlet for four nights, a very well appointed most unusual boutique hotel, positioned close to Chinatown and many bars and restaurants. Marina Bay was a short MRT subway ride away or a steady 25 minute walk if you fancy it. We had an executive room with a balcony which was small but enough for the amount of time we spent in it. The room was beautifully furnished and kept spotlessly clean by our maid. Front desk could not have been more helpful and friendly, a special mention for Nigel who went beyond the call to help us when needed. We would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again without hesitation. Sue and Paul Bishop",10,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We had a great stay at Scarlet. We were only there for 2 nights as a part of a layover on the last leg of our trip. But it was in a great location. We didnât fly out till late the next day so after check out staff held our bags for us so we could continue exploring and allowed us to use the shower services to freshen up before the flight. I really like the decor but some areas do seem like they need a bit of r&r. Some spots of the wall paper are looking a bit worse for wear and it ages the hotel. Otherwise it was very clean and had great staff and amenities,8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The location is right next to China town, plenty of restaurants and hawker complex. The highlight of the stay at the Scarlet was the staff, thank you Leslie Lee for administering first aid to a bruised and bloodied shin, thank you to Bincy for helping with cases and offering post check out showers. Big thank you to all the other staff who ordered taxis for us, kept an eye out for them, opened doors and general helped where they could. Taxi are cheap and a source of tourist information.",10,Nov-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,The Scarlet Hotel fit our needs this trip to Singapore.  We wanted to move away from the harbour front and Clarke Quay and decided to try this gem in Chinatown and it certainly provided us with a great location and lots to see and do within a short distance.  The rooms are not huge but are large enough for a couple and have all that is expected.  The short walk to the MRT proved very handy and the quiet rooms allowed us to catch up jet lag.  The only short fall is no pool to cool off although there is a small spa.,8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Coming back over and over, tried many different rooms without being ever disappointed (and yes, be advised that lots of them are either tiny or have a skylight instead of a window -if that's a problem for you, don't stay in a heritage district building, go for faceless business hotels elsewhere). Location couldn't be better. Hotel with a real personality, decoration is deliciously ""lil' bit too much"", rooftop bar and outdoor jacuzzi are a big plus at the end of a tiring business / shopping day! A big thanks you to the helpfull staff (Nazir and Jonathan mostly) for going out of their way to send me back a pair of reading glasses!",8,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Booked a room for New Yearâs Eve. Check-in was uneventful, our booking said welcome drinks but none were offered. We asked for information about the bar and the concierge told us to go to the 4th floor to ask...  the room was nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable but the bathroom stunk! Not sure if thereâs a plumbing problem in that room(225) but the smell of rotten eggs was everywhere in the bathroom . In the morning, we woke up to 2 cockroaches wandering our room... nice morning touch . There is not reason for this hotel to not have a robust pest control system. There was no food in our room...   Checkout was worse then checkin. The lady didnât ask us how our stay was, just said have a nice day Not sure if the horrible service was due it being New Yearâs Eve and day butâ¦",4,Jan-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Very clean charming hotel ..good location walking to Chinatown ,subway station... Just a little not easy to find the street walking from sub station.. Room is small but confortable... Otherwise pleasant stay area. ",8,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Both my fiancÃ© and I loved this hotel. The location was perfect and only 200 meters to the nearest MRT. The hotel was beautiful and celebrated their historical heritage.  We were very impressed with the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room. The bed was a little hard, but the staff gave us a couple of duvets to make it softer.   We will definitely return to this hotel. ",10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"we stayed here our last two nights after a 17 day cruise from dubai the hotel was very nice set in old china town very close to shopping and some good street food  we stayed in a room with a large balcony over looking the street ,the room was old but still well looked after  the front staff upon arrival were very friendly and accomodating for sure   Singapore is not a cheap city so be prepared for breakfast costs and other attractions that cost far more than one can imagine but all in all we had a pleasant stay and would stay again because of its proximity to transit and things",8,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Loved the concept of this hotel being a heritage property above a row of shops. Great location close to lots of fab restaurants and bars, the Maxwell Road hawker centre and Chinatown.  Our room was very small and it was difficult to store our luggage. But it was comfortable and had everything we needed.  Nice touch that we were able to use the shower facilities before heading back to the airport for our flight.",8,Nov-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,Amazing boutique hotel. Super close to Chinatown and walking distance to many other sites. Lovely rooftop restaurant and bar to relax in after a busy day exploring. Highly recommend. Room 202 was spacious and had a balcony with double doors.,10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Great location, easy access to 2 tube stations and walking distance to most things anyway. The room we were in didn't have a window which was a pity, because otherwise it was perfect. Reception staff was helpful. We didn't like the smell at reception, some sort of deodorant which didn't smell nice at all. Other than that happy with the choice. ",8,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"This boutique hotel is right in the heart of Chinatown, 2 minutes from the Buddha tooth temple. It has a very unique style which sets it apart. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. The rooms aren't huge but they have everything you need. The bathroom had a good shower and nice toiletries. The gym was small but functional and there was a small hottub too. On departure day, they allow you to leave your bags and then use a shower room when you return to collect them, which was excellent. Good value too given the location. ",8,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Having arrived at the Scarlet rather earlier than the official check-in time from a long and tiring flight from London, I was able to take advantage of the 24/7 shower facilities at Soda (the hotel's spa area) to freshen up ahead of my room being available.  It was my third stay at the Scarlet, and - as with the previous times - the Executive room was super clean and very comfortable.  There are numerous excellent eateries (including Michelin-starred and Michelin Bib Gourmand ones) within a short walk of the hotel.   A big thank you to Emily and her colleagues for their superlative customer service throughout my 2-day stay at the Scarlet.",10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,This is the perfect base to explore Singaporeâs China town. Love the attention to detail. Love the extra items supplied. Excellent base to explore China town for shopping and eating. The street in from of the Scarlet is a one way street. ,10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,The Scarlet was a very clean & quiet hotel at the edge of Chinatown. Plenty of places to eat & drink nearby. Good base to explore from. Staff very friendly especially Machelle on reception. We were offered chance to shower and freshen up as we arrived a few hours before our room was ready. Recommend to stay here if want away from standard hotels. ,8,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We just enjoyed a short stay at The Scarlet. The staff were brilliant, the room was beautiful and the location was just about perfect, just a couple of minutes from Chinatown. I canât recommend this place highly enough. ",10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Stayed for 2 nights to watch the U2 concert. We chose this hotel based on recommendations and proximity to restaurants and bars.  The hotel is beautiful, really chic and full of character. The rooms are tastefully decorated, the beds comfortable. The staff are amazing and very professional. Will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel.",10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We stayed here on a short break en route back to UK from NZ.  Had a lovely time!  Staff were really helpful (special thanks to Machelle) and nothing was too much trouble.  Room was really comfortable and very clean.  Location of the hotel is great too - just a minute or so from the heart of Chinatown and within easy walking distance of the MRT (make sure you have small denomination notes when you go to buy your ticket from the machine).  The area felt very safe and the food in the nearby hawker center was great and not expensive at all.  Have already recommended the hotel to friends and will definitely book again when we go back.  Thanks for a great stay,10,Nov-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"It was my wedding anniversary stay. My husband and I were surprised and touched by the anniversary card signed by the manager and staff. The staff even helped me to trick my husband (I was busy preparing). This place has really friendly and hospitality level was excellent. The place is very nearby to cafes, bars and restaurants and walking distance to Chinatown Point and MRT. Really love this place. Hope to stay again!",10,Nov-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The staff at the scarlet have been fantastic and the hotel itself has many services that you might not have thought about, such as the shower room to freshen up before your return trip home.   The room was great, with a free, complementary minibar that was restocked daily (comes with the more premium room).   We would stay again. We easily used the local MRT to get to all of the tourist hot spots and regularly enjoyed walking as the area is stunning and very safe. And if itâs raining, thereâs lots to do locally and the staff can get you a cab in less then five minutes.   You wonât be disappointed with a stay at the scarlet. It might even make your holiday.",10,Nov-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The front desk lady (Rosy/Rosie, donât know the exact spelling) was not helpful at all when i ask to borrow an umbrella because my cab was arriving soon. She refused to even check for any available umbrella but insisted i walked back up to my room to get it. Instead it was a inhouse guest/tourist who helpfully offered me his umbrella.   The aircon in the room was not cold enough despite tuning to the lowest temperature. ",6,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We stayed at The Scarlett for 4 night in November and had a very wonderful stay prior to our wedding. All the staff were very helpful specially Leslie, Rosie and Emily for all the support when my partner had an injury. Thanks you for your wonderful hospitality and we hope to see you again when we are back in Singapore.",10,Nov-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We spent part of our honeymoon here; we loved that the hotel had a sexy vibe and was unique. The staff were friendly, welcoming and accommodating and decorated our bed with gifts to help us celebrate our honeymoon. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because of a booking error on their part resulting in us missing out on breakfast for 2 out of the 3 days. Although the hotel gave us a bottle of wine to say sorry, we probably would have preferred a partial refund instead (especially as we'd paid extra for an upgrade when checking in).",8,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. Location is very convenient for walking around Chinatown, right next to Maxwell Food Centre and many bars and restaurants all on the doorstep. Decor is lovely",8,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The hotel staff couldn't be happier to see you and are extremely helpful. The breakfast is an eclectic mix of European and local food which is an interesting change, but you soon come to enjoy it! Very clean and sparkling. A lovely relaxing place from which ChinaTown is very easily accessible. It is a great location and has a unique style of its own. Great hotel, excellent staff.",10,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I booked this hotel for my parents who love boutique hotels and they loved it. Amazing location.  Fantastic staff .  Beautiful rooms.  Bathroom is quite a decent size which is unusual for a small place. Aria Rooftop bar and restaurant is also attached via the internal lift, which was a plus  On the down-side, the rooms are very small. With 2 big suitcases my folks were struggling for space. just one person though? perfect  NB: some people warned that not all rooms have a window so i booked one with a balcony. the balcony was quite big actually.",8,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,This hotel was simply wonderfull the room the staff the food the location which was in china town and all the social areas were all simply fantastic we had the time of our life this is also a very unique hotel full of oriental charn thank you glenda begg,10,Jul-18,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The Scarlet Hotel feels homely the moment you walk into the foyer. We loved the character of the decor, the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff and the great location. We were easily able to walk to most things and other places were no more than a couple of stops on the cityâs unbelievably efficient metro. The bed was super comfy, the room spotlessly clean and we had the benefit of a jacuzzi right outside our door. Others on here have commented on some street noise but we actually found it to be incredibly quiet. A great place to stay and good value by Singapore standards. ",10,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Due to its Low-rise building structure, it might be disturbing to have all the noises made by the traffic directly outside of the hotel 24/7. However it has excellent staff especially Leslie whom gave us an room upgrade and free breakfast due to a booking error that Iâve made. Overall 4/5!",8,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"At the end of the day, it's clean rooms, decent space, reasonable access to transport and eateries that you need. And the Scarlet does provide it, but at an exorbitant rate. Or so I felt. I stayed 2 nights there and everything was ok. The front desk staff (Jonathan especially) was very helpful, trying to get me an early check-in, helping me with eating recommendations etc.  It's a good hotel but frankly over priced.",6,May-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"This hotel is perfect for business travels, close to downtown so you can easily get to the office; and close to chinatown so you can find some nice street food in the evening. I do recommend and will get back there next time I'm in Singapore! And they have nice outside jacuzzi as well :) ",10,May-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We were in a en-suite room with nice balcony and next to the jaccuzzi. Room very elegantly decorated, very quiet, friendly and helpful staff. Conveniently located, close to public transport.  Cozy rooftop bar.",10,May-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We spent 3 nights on the top floor (3rd floor) during our stay in Singapore. We chose The Scarlet Singapore for it's combination of location and price. We would not stay here again.  To get to our room from the elevator we still needed to climb an additional 6 to 8 stairs. Our room was very small, but adequate. On our second night, the electricity was out on the entire 3rd floor when we arrived back at the hotel. We had to use our phones to see the stairs in the dark and find our way to our room. Electricity was on and off all night that night, going out again every couple of hours. That meant no air conditioning, which is vital for us in hot, humid climates. When the electricity went out, we would have to phone the front desk in order to have someone resolve the issue. Thoughâ¦",4,May-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,Rozie very helpful at the front desk.  Didnât realize how big the hotel was.  Small gym but good enough to get a workout in.  Many shops easily walking distance and bars.  Jacuzzi area small but worth hanging out in if no one else is there . ,10,May-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,This is a nice clean hotel right next to china town . I also thought it was good value for money my room was a nice size bed was comfy and WiFi was good . The jacuzzi was a nice place to relax after a lot of walking round the city ,8,May-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Stayed in Scarlet 4 nights! Entrance and reception is absolutely outstanding, welcome drink was a nice touch too! However, rooms are small but functional. We had the little balcony and jacuzzi was just outside our room. We thought it will be great, but had very loud guests having fun in the middle of the night, so the sleep was really badly disturbed. Staff tried their hardest to get loud guests out, but it took them 1h and also police was involved. Jacuzzi didnât smell good, so we only tried once. The other thing to mention is deposit. Even after more then 20 days stay my deposit is still not back onto my account. Contacted 3 times, but been told should be in my account in 7-14 days. Didnât happen. My bank canât do anything but wait, so frustrating. Stayed in other 2 hotels inâ¦",6,Apr-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"As someone else has reported, the taxi driver from the airport did not know where it is.  The front door says 'Scarlet' on the floor but the sign that's visible from a car next to it says something different.  Once entering, the whole place has an air of slightly off-centre sophistication.  Certainly there is plenty of red, including the hallways between rooms, but there are also lots of adornments that somehow don't quite not work.  The room itself was clean and though not the biggest, had enough space for a short business stay.  The bathroom was a reasonable size, the air conditioning worked well.  There were quite a few nice touches such as an umbrella to use on rainy days, and a 'personal assistant' (a smart phone that can be taken with you whilst you stay to give touristâ¦",8,Apr-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I stayed here for two night in March 2019. Check in was quick and efficient and I was greeted with a cold drink and towel, welcome after the humid seat outside. My room was on the second floor. The floors to the rooms are uneven which didn't bother me, but might not be ideal for those with mobility issues. My room was spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated and well appointed with nice bath products, a mini fridge and the coziest bathrobe and slippers. They are building an MRT station nearby, but I never noticed any extra noise during my day, and it was a very quick walk to the famous Maxwell Food Centre for lunch. Would happily stay here again. ",10,Mar-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The Scarlet is the perfect place to stay for a night or two while you are exploring Singapore. The value for the quality of the room as well as the location is hard to beat. I'd definitely suggest getting a room other than the basic so you have some natural light coming into your room through either a skylight and/or window. The hotel is well equipped with a rooftop bar, gym access and really everything you need in a hotel room. The location is close to multiple hawker centres and is a quick walk to the Chinatown Metro Station which can really get you anywhere in the city pretty quickly. The staff is helpful and will help make your stay as comfortable as they can. Definitely recommend if you're looking to not pay too much for accommodation but still get a good hotel. ",10,Dec-18,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Fabulous location. Room was very suitable. Glad we booked here over our first chosen hotel. First two days staff didnât service room properly but when queried, it was promptly amended each day after that. Reception staff didnât always go out of their way to greet - but generally the service was very good, prompt and friendly. I would stay here again and recommend for a suitable 4 star stay. A pool wouldâve been good as the weather was super hot each day but frankly we were so tired sightseeing we probably wouldnât have used it! ",10,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We enjoyed staying at the Scarlet for a quick layover in Singapore.  Good hawker center across the street.  Pleasant to walk around Chinatown at night and check out the bar scene around the corner.  The rooms were quiet and the staff lovely.  Great breakfast with western and Chinese options.,10,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,The Scarlet was positioned well in Singapore's Chinatown area. The staff looked after us well. Close to subway train system MRT and transport options were easy. Plenty of choices for restaurants in the area.,10,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,This hotel is awesome and the location is super. Next to Maxwell food market and other shops in the area. The breakfast was very limited. Still would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a luxury hotel,10,Jul-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,The Scarlet is a real gem of a heritage hotel. Not a smidge of chrome or artificial swan lines. Just a genuine historical building in the most fantastic location. Chinatown and temples are on the doorstep. The food court just around the corner is wonderful and just the place for breakfast. Rosie and staff are brilliantly helpful and made the stay for us. Thank you.,10,Sep-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"You asked me for a review on this hotel which I did then You asked me to resubmit my review using more words, unfortunately the review I submitted was my true thoughts on this hotel. Asking me to change my review, in my view pad it out; would not then be my considered view but one that was made only to meet your guidelines which I would not feel comfortable with. Sorry, also your drop down menu for when we stayed didnât go back to when we last stayed there.",8,Oct-18,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We booked this hotel back in September 2018 for our 6 days in Singapore in July 2019 and so glad we booked this beautiful boutique hotel.  I really can't fathom the bad reviews for this hotel.  We opted for an Executive double room with Balcony, the room was beautifully designed and well equipped and large enough for our short stay following 18 days in Borneo.  We had 2 large rucksacks which were stowed easily in our room, there is a large enough wardrobe to store everything.  The bathroom had a decent sized shower cubicle with a lovely shower, so clean and the toiletries were lovely.  Our balcony was at the back of the hotel which could be noisy at times but the hotel thoughtfully supply earplugs to block out any noise.  The bed was so comfortable and  we slept peacefully everyâ¦",10,Jul-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"A grand entrance lobby, but otherwise this hotel is very dark, with long windowless corridors. The room was also quite dark. The hotel is in easy walk of a metro stop and close to Chinatown and all the restaurants there. However, there is a new station being built bang opposite the hotel and works carry on at night, which despite ear plugs woke us a couple of times.",6,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Stayed here just recently and could not wait to get out of the place. The room was like a dungeon with no windows so always dark and completely dismal. The bed was so hard we couldnât sleep, the bed covers barely covered the bed and the room so small there was a mere 10-12 inches between the wall and the bed to try to get in and out. The towel rail was inside the shower cubicle so got wet and although I asked for another it was not forthcoming. The attached Italian Restaurant had terrible food. Do not stay here if you want to be comfortable.",2,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"What sets this boutique hotel apart is simply this - customer service. Yes, it is very comfortable and yes, it is brillaintly located. Recently my wife and I had a one night stopover booking. We felt like regular, valued customers. Two staff in particular did all they could to make us welcome when we arrived early and checked out leaving our baggage there as we had a midnight flight. Leslie Lee, Assistant Guest Relations Manager and Nazir, Guest Relation Executive gave us amazing personalised service allowing us to gain entry to our room early and then shower before we left to go to the airport. They were excellent communicators and seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs and making their customers' experiences the best they could be. Other staff we dealt with in small ways wereâ¦",10,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,I visited the hotel almost 7 hours prior to my check in and the staff at the hotel was very receptive of me. They were overbooked the day I arrived and they made sure I was at home the time I was waiting by them to arrange a room for me. The people working at the concierge were just such amazing and lively people Leslie and Michell,10,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,The hotel is immediately welcoming with very nice decor! We were immediately greeted with a welcome drink at the reception and the check-in process was smooth.  The room itself was very quiet and comfortable and location was also good.  The staff members were extremely helpful and caring - special thanks to Nazir for immediately making us feel welcome and also for his assistance and also thanks to Rozie who was very willing to share her knowledge with us when we asked for some recommendations.  Breakfast was also excellent - the person in charge of breakfast was also very nice and attentive!! Overall it was a very great experience and would highly recommend this hotel!!,10,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"My friend and I stayed at The Scarlet for 2 nights. Whilst the rooms are on the small side, it is perfect for a few nights and when out exploring all day. The hotel has an old fashioned and quirky feel but oozes luxury which makes it so unique to Singapore!  The staff were accommodating and extremely friendly - a special mention to Rozie for being so welcoming. We visited Aria rooftop restaurant on our final night in Singapore and although we hadnât stayed at this hotel for 2 days, we were able to store our luggage safely and relax whilst having dinner. Something which the hotel definitely did not need to do!  The location is great - less than a 5 minute walk from Chinatown, a hawkers food market and quaint street with independent restaurants, making you feel like you are inâ¦",10,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,My wife and I travel to Singapore at least 3 times per year. We are always looking for good options but I suggest giving this one a miss. The rooms are small as are the beds. It is run down and unclean. The location is average with access to the China town area across an uncontrolled busy road. The staff were disinterested. Be careful of the hidden penalty charges is small print on the check in forms - $200 is a significant and unwelcome surprise after you leave. Overall very disappointing.,2,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Old world charm, quiet and great location. From the welcome beverage to the unique decor which sets you back to a different age....great experience and would certainly stay here again. Loved my time here",10,Jun-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"This is a beautiful boutique hotel in a great location. It's situated in Chinatown with a 5 min walk to China Food Street and behind the hotel are a few nice bars. There is a 7 Eleven at the end of the hotel and a few shops situated at the front of the hotel exterior.   My room was a good size, clean and quiet. Staff were very friendly and helpful both at at check in and check out. The hotel itself is nice with a rooftop restaurant and a hot tub available to guests. I would definitely come back!",10,Jul-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"This was my second stay with Scarlet this year. I was so impressed with my first short stay I came for a longer stay to explore Singapore more. Due to an issue with my requested room I was advised in advance and generously upgraded to a Premium room with a bath and that as nice to soak the day away.  The staff are very kind and professional and it was great to meet some of them.  Itâs awkward to say, but breakfast wasnât up to scratch, BUT in saying that, the hotel are so caring they hopped straight onto the restaurant tenant to rectify the teething problems of transitioning to a plated breakfast service. I stress here the breakfast is provided by the restaurant, not the hotel, but were keen to make sure it was up to standard for guests.  We felt very looked after by all theâ¦",10,Jul-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We had 3 nights at the scarlet hotel in august. the location was great - right in chinatown and very close to the bus stop for the hop-on hop-off bus. Plenty of restaurants near by. The staff were helpful and kind, though we didn't really have much to do with them other than check-in and check-out. The rooms however are very small, only just enough space for the two of us. We had an executive balcony room. There was nowhere to put the suitcase other than on the bed or right in the doorway. The room seemed to have an un-functional layout.  I think the location is just enough to recommend that people stay here, given we spent so little time in the room - just there for sleeping and thats it.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Found the hotel online and liked the look/sound of it. And what a find. It more than met my expectations and the high standards I look for when travelling. The hotel is housed in 1880's shop houses and is a fabulous blend of heritage and modern.  The bedroom was huge and beautifully appointed (it lacked nothing), with a very comfortable bed.  A bonus was the mobile phone provided for personal use, including free international calls, and preloaded with apps useful for a visitor to Singapore.  The hotel is very well located, especially for exploring Chinatown, and the fantastic Maxwell hawker centre is just across the road.  The staff are super friendly and helpful, especially Jonathon, who kindly arranged a late checkout for me and access to shower facilities later in the dayâ¦",10,Aug-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We stayed at this hotel a few years ago and it was amazing but our return visit was a disappointment. It is in a great position in Chinatown and within a nice walking distance of downtown Singapore about a slow 30 min walk about 45 min drive from the airport. There are loads of great looking restaurants within walking distance of the hotel if you want to stay close and there is a nice rooftop terrace serving food and drinks/cocktails. There are two MRT stations fairly close if you don't fancy the walk. The hotel lobby is amazing when you walk in, bold colours and deep velvet chairs and beautiful chandeliers. The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable about the city and will do anything to help you in anyway they can. Our first problem was that we had booked a deluxe room at anâ¦",6,Jul-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"This boutique hotel is at the heart of China Town, right by the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Amoy Street Food Centre. The hotel is in a row of old shop houses with a real colonial feel. The roof top bar has a nice view. Don't be fooled by the clever use of lighting and mirrors. Many rooms do not have a window and they won't necessarily tell you. It's essential to check when you book.",6,Mar-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Had a very nice welcome, the person in the reception walked me to my room, showed the amenities while giving me cote's information. Did not interact much, but staff always courteous  The room was great for Singapore standards, I stayed on an Executive room, only complaint light leaking into room at night, but that's a personal thing. I prefer total blackness in order to sleep I checked out earlier and kept my suitcase at hotel. I came back and I was offered complementary shower! I never had that before. Machelle was wonderful, she booked a grab taxi and waited with me until the taxi came and she even waited to say good bye outside the hotel door, I never that happened except some places in Japan",10,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We went to singapore for the first time and stayed in the scarlet hotel.  Firstly the location is fantastic, in the heart of chinatown around the corner from the Maxwell food centre which is a must visit not just for foodies and not far from the chinatown mrt station. The staff are friendly and very helpful and we were welcomed with a complementary drink which after an 13 and half hour flight was a nice touch.  The room was clean and tiny and the right size for the 2 of us. We visited the roof top bar in the hotel which has a fantastic atmosphere with good Italian food and views.  A lovely hotel and we would definitely come back.",10,Oct-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Whoever had the idea of converting this former street of derelict Chinatown âshophousesâ into a hotel did a great job.  You can feel some of the history of the area in this property and it has close proximity to the centre of Chinatown and the excellent Chinatown Heritage Museum.  We asked for a room upgrade at this hotel because we had been warned that some rooms donât have windows.  However the âExecutiveâ room that we ended up in was extremely cramped and the dÃ©cor looked tired.  There was no room to store our suitcases to the extent that we had to climb over them every time we got in and out of bed.  Clearly, they accommodate very small executives in this hotel.  The hotel is opposite a food market and construction site.  Consequently, there is noise as every room faces ontoâ¦",6,Dec-19,
The Scarlet Singapore,We were greeted by Nigel whose efficient and friendly manner made us feel even happier to arrive in Singapore. The following days we were greeted by Nazir. His warm and relaxed manner felt genuine. On our last few days Faizz was very helpful and efficient He managed our booking for an additional night.. All of you guys made it a memorable experience. Thanks again we really appreciate it.  The Scarletâs location is ideal for the Maxwell food court and buzzing China town. The Scarlet itself is on a quiet street.,10,Dec-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,"We stayed at The Scarlet over NYE and had a pleasant experience. The concept is fantastic: an entire row of heritage terrace houses refurbished and converted into a hotel. The room was on the small side, and though the check in staff was kind enough to accommodate our request for a window, there really wasnât much of a view to speak of...also, the rogue green light emanating from the smoke alarm was bright enough to be a distraction through the night - but at this price, we couldnât really fault the place. It does have a real charm, from the lavish lobby to the unbeatable Chinatown location, adjacent to Maxwell Hawker Centre and Club Street, which more than compensated for the blips.",8,Jan-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Stayed at The Scarlet Singapore while in Singapore for 7 nights, recently.  Rooms are clean, the front desk is available 24 hours, and the location gives you immediate access to Chinatown and is within walking distance to major tourist areas. The staff, from the time we checked in to the time we checked out, was extremely helpful. Not only did they provide recommendations for adventures, routes to take, cater to our requests quickly, they also help my mother and me navigate the COVID-19-related requirements and testing. I cannot reiterate enough that the staff at the Scarlett Singapore Hotel, especially Nawauri, Faizz, Nazir, and Diana, made our time in Singapore 100X better amidst the peak COVID outbreak.",10,Dec-21,

Finally with fantastic Faizz who made my stay unbelievable flawless till the farewell. They literally are 6-star people!!!

The Scarlet Singapore,"The Scarlet is well situated in Chinatown and close access to three MRT stations. Its position is also well situated for food and shopping. No where is too far in Singapore due to excellent MRT; however, some hotels such as along Orchard Road do not allow for closer cultural experiences. Apart from Chinatown itself and the Buddha Tooth Temple, there is a nearby Taoist temple and Peranakan house to explore. It is walking distance to the Marina Bay areas as well- if you like walking.  The hotel is very comfortable with rooms being very clean and quiet. The open mini bar and free breakfast was a great deal and I chose an executive room; however, the cheaper rooms were quite spacious as well. Note that these rooms may or may not have a window.

The Scarlet Singapore,"My boyfriend and I went to The Scarlet Hotel on 14th Jan 2022 to celebrate his birthday. We like to give a big thanks to Haley. We were surprised by her beautiful gestures, lovely welcome, excellent services.  She surprised us with an awesome room which was specially decorated with a birthday theme. The hotel sponsored a bottle of red wine, beverages and snacks.  She helped us to take photos to create memorable memories. She shared with us about the hotel's Valentine's Day and Christmas promotions. That attracted us to stay The Scarlet Hotel  again. It definitely worths the return visits.",10,Jan-22,

The Scarlet Singapore,"Hotel has a lovely ambience throughout my stay there. The interior design is aesthetically pleasing with their antique/modern style fusion.   My check-in process was handled well and professionally by Qistina and Faizz at the reception. Housekeeping made my room clean when I came back after a day out. Not many hotels like The Scarlet Hotel have a complimentary minibar so I was quite pleased with what they provided, which included two KitKat bars!   To the food connoisseurs, there are a number of F&B establishments around the area which includes both Halal and Non-Halal options.  I will definitely recommend a stay at The Scarlet to my family and friends as my family and I will absolutely come back for another staycation.",10,Dec-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,I was shocked to receive a cancellation booking from Agoda on the same day that our VTL guest will check in later in the afternoon. I was attended by Faizz directly for the reservation. He has provided excellent and prompt service. I would highly recommend his service and attention to my matter.,10,Dec-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,My wife and I stayed at the Scarlet Singapore once the VTL opened with Australia. We were warmly greeted at some ungodly hour by Faizal who looked after us and welcomed us as if we were family. We were also fortunate to be looked after by Nazir who kindly reduced the cost of our laundry because of an error by the service provider. The location was great and would stay there again.   There is the Maxwell Hawker centre just a 3 minute walk away and the Maxwell MTR will possibly be open in the coming months. If you are looking for a lovely front office crew (apologies to those whose names I haven't included) stay here.,10,Nov-21,

I would like to mention Qistina (GSA) and Nigel (DM) for their warm and affectionate hospitality upon my arrival.  As for the highlight of the stay. I requested for the birthday cake to be sent up to my room at midnight on the dot.

This is very rare in the hotel industry nowadays as mostly the staff are either not warm or not as genuine. We only intend to stay few hours and so we didnât want the grand room; yet he treated me as special guest.   He didnât know this, but Iâm actually a regular of their hotel.

He's very polite, professional and at the same time, very welcoming. He's a good example of how a frontline hotel ambassador ought to be.   For example, during a stay in February, he takes his own initiative to make my girlfriend and I feel welcomed.  I told him that tomorrow is my girlfriend's birthday and I left for a walk, not expecting him to do anything as we were just chatting. However, when I returned with my girlfriend, we were surprised by the birthday card and chocolates he placed by our door. It was really a pleasant surprise!

The Scarlet Singapore,"I really liked this hotel. The staff were super friendly. They were always happy for a chat and were responsive to requests.  The balcony room was a nice size and I enjoyed sitting on the balcony watching the world go by.   The bed was hard as a rock though and I struggled to sleep most nights for the 9 nights I was there.  In stark contrast the pillows were super soft and my head went right through them to the bed. I called for more pillows and was only allowed 2 more (my wife also wanted 2 more for the same reason and was denied).   The location is excellent. It's a stone's throw from the Maxwell Hawker and the Maxwell MRT (when it opens very soon) and a short walk to the heart of Chinatown.   Hard bed aside, I'd definitely stay again. ",8,Jan-22,

The room (with a rear facing balcony) was a treat, I can't say enough about it. When we ventured out into the heritage Ann Siang Hill area we were equally delighted.

Itâs in the heart of Chinatown and well located for restaurants and exploring the interesting streets and old shop houses, most now renovated.   The rooms are very small, some do not have windows so be warned.   We arrived mid afternoon and were checked in promptly.

The hotel is clean, great wifi, and has a beautiful vintage and classy look, with gorgeous chandeliers, mirrors, and antique furniture. The location is excellent - one block from Chinatown and across from a great food court with tons of authentic food options (the Maxwell Food Center); not only do locals eat there, but you can share tables and talk with people about Singapore.

The Scarlet Singapore,Fantastic location just on the border of Chinatown but still enjoys a quiet neighbourhood. The staff were always friendly and asked how we were and if we needed any assistance each day. Whilst our room was in the basement we didnât have any issue with lighting as there was a light well in the ceiling which provided natural light. Room was small - compact  but felt enough. And bathroom was good.  Definitely recommmend if you want to stay in Chinatown. ,10,Feb-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Very Friendly Staff.  They even provided us with recommendations on breakfast places to consider in the morning.  There was a lot to see within walking distance of the hotel and there were two train stations within 5-10 minutes walk as well.  It was very close to Chinatown but just off the main street so we couldn't here the traffic noise.  The room was good too.  I thinks they may have upgraded us from a room without a window to a room with a skylight.  Don't worry about there not being windows ( I was a little concerned about this aspect prior to arriving, never having experienced it before) as it makes for a very restful sanctuary during the day when escaping from the heat outside.  It does make it hard to gauge what time it is though.  I would stay here again.",10,Jan-20,

The Scarlet Singapore,"Wanted to bring my parents out for a staycation and decided to book here since it was an area my parents are used to.  Was very pleased with the service that the hotel staff, especially Diana showed.  She was very attentive and very professional to our needs.  Such a blessing to make our stay enjoyable.  Will definitely visit the place again next time with my parents.  The area is also well known to many good food in Singapore and all within walking distance.",10,Nov-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,Stayed 4 nights in this little gem of a Hotel in the 'China Town' district of Singapore. A former Mid Victoria Chop House now an agreeable cozy little hotel - I was impressed. Shout out to Rosie the Manager and and her able assistant Macelle who seemingly were ever present and always cordial. RECOMMENDED,10,Jan-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"I truly appreciated the hotel quality and the dedication of the design, not sure how other room is actually looks like but for my executive with balcony is very comfortable and well design. The tolietries and amenities like coffee and tea is truly a plus point, just like the hotel design itself the coffee and tea is really good quality and i may say high end that is why would you even go out your hotel room to have a good coffee or rather instead having it inside? The answer is indoor stay with their coffee is great! The tolietries is even the best! They served a great enough big size travelling body foam and a big travel size tooth tube from compare to normal or high end hotel in singapore, if i would have choose to come back in future i will choose here! They have greatâ¦",10,May-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The Scarlet staffs was excellent - Nazir made everything go smoothly when I arrived and check in went really smooth. Concierge service was excellent - Machelle, Lesley, Nigel and Jonathan was very helpful and friendly in making several needs and reservations. Location wise is convenient to MRT and  to find foods (Halal). Selection and quality was very much appreciated. (The staff) is one of best parts of staying at The Scarlet Singapore. Everyone is very thoughtful and caring to insure that you are enjoying your stay and follow the safety measures.  Thank you!",10,May-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"The hotel is right by Chinatown and also right by club road which has many restaurants and bars.    The room was clean and average size.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.   We walked everywhere from the hotel.  We did have some people come in at 6am from partying all night and it was loud.   Not the hotelâs fault, but it woke us up out of a sound sleep.  We would still stay there again.",10,Jan-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,Excellent customer service. Greeted us with very warm welcome. Very cozy room. Nice place to have a quiet piece of mind. Convenient store near by. Pubs and bar is like 2mins walk. Sadly jacuzzi was close due to covid but still a very nice place to go to!,10,Mar-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Nice Scarlett Ted theme, Hotel and room are good value for money.  Premium room is more spacious. Pick the room with skylight, high ceiling. Well situated to explore Chinatown. Breakfast in the restaurant, just ok but the venue is nice (Mediterranean style)",8,Oct-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Heard so much about this much-raved boutique. And because of the pandemic, I finally got to be a tourist in my own country and checked out this hotel.  The Deluxe Room (that I booked) was of a good size. Only small quibble is the small table and slightly uncomfortable chair (which wasn't so comfortable when trying to get some work done on my laptop). But it was nice having the daylight coming through from the ceiling (pretty conducive to waking up earlier as well) + love the soft Tempur pillows used as well.  Plus friendly staff at the reception desk who are very welcoming to guest queries.  If there are things that can be improved, probably have the option for a co-work corner (as mentioned above, the table is slightly on the small side) + also more in-room dining options viaâ¦",8,Oct-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,"Booking.com screw up my booking and it makes the beginning to my staycation a sour one. HOWEVER when a staff like Nigel (front office manager) step up and goes his way to check us in eventhough booking.com and its travel partner made the screw up,my staycation turns from a sour start to a sweet ending.  The hotel is perfect for couple who need to be away and with the complimentary mini bar makes one not want to leave the room. Mini bar is fully stocked. Couple of choices..not just ure typical mineral water . They even provide a few snacks too!  The cheapest room has no window but just a small skylight so room can be very claustrophobic for some. Also the bed can be hard for some and pillows are super soft. Not ideal for people like me. No bathtub but water pressure is goodâ¦",8,Oct-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,"No one was at the front desk while checking in till a lady came forward from back office. Everything was ok and pretty basic, making way to lift lobby and room was like a maze. Room wise was quite small and mirrors were facing at the front and side of the bed so it was kind of weird design and the room phone was not working too.",6,Aug-21,
The Scarlet Singapore,"First and foremost, I am impressed by the interior design of the hotel. The exterior make it seems like the hotel will be small but the moment I stepped into the hotel I was impressed by the furnishing and how spacious the lobby was. Located at the heart of the CBD area with great eateries around. Adjacent to the hotel is the famous local hawker centre; maxwell. And at the back of the hotel was filled with restaurants and bars at Ann Siang road, Club St. Its pretty interesting.  Was warmly greeted by Emily who did the check in for us.

The Scarlet Singapore,"A very good hotel with nice clean and functional rooms and a nice atmosphere. The staff is very helpful and service-minded. It's conveniently located in a quiet area with only a few minutes walk to public transportation in Chinatown or just a few hundred meters in the other direction from the hotel so you have the whole city nearby.  If you just want a quick budget meal there is a food court just around the corner and you have a lot of Chinese restaurants to choose from in Chinatown walking street that agents to the hotel street, otherwise there is plenty of all kinds of good restaurants nearby.",10,Jan-20,
The Scarlet Singapore,"My cousin and I did a two-night staycation over the weekend at The Scarlet. Since it was not my first time staying there, I must admit that the rooms weren't as spectacular as they once were when I stayed there a good 15 years ago (which is to be expected).   That said, the front desk staff, Faizal and Machelle, more than made up for this. They were friendly and attentive and did whatever they could to make our stay enjoyable, from ensuring that our faulty internet connection was promptly fixed to always greeting us with warm smiles and some conversation - plus a readiness to spring into action should we need anything - each time we passed them coming in or going out.    We would certainly recommend other potential guests to give The Scarlet a try and wish to thank Faizal andâ¦",8,Jul-21,

The Scarlet Singapore,Very smooth and pleasant experience at The Scarlet. Reserved a room with balcony at room 306 for my birthday on 9/7-10/7.  The room was clean and excellent housekeeping service!  Special thanks and compliments to the front desk girl serving us in the afternoon ( forgot her name).

The Scarlet Singapore,"It was a comfortable stay. Although I booked last minute through a third party site, when I called to check the reservations if it is confirmed the staff is a bit unsure of what to do because it will take a while for the booking to sync with their system. Whilst, when I arrived the receptionist is friendly, she actually thought Iâm kind of mystery shopper (random quality checks for hotels) as she knew Iâm a hotelier too. So far, I have a great stay. The hotel theme is vintage, theatrical and stylish. The bed and pillow is very comfty, their TV has apps like Netflix,  browsers and etc. The room has complete amenities too (bathrobes, slippers, hair dryer, toothbrush & etc.) As the ones I booked comes with bathtub, there is actually seasalt scrub provided as well.

When stepped into room was cold, carpet near closet had previous guest trash, no vanity kit, comb, a bit dusty in certain area of the room and certain area of ceiling started to have water seepage and grouting starting to be moldy. Other then that it will be perfect. I was greeted warmly and smooth check in by FO gentleman and checkout by a sweet looking lady. Didn't managed to get their names.",6,Jul-21,

He also added pillows in the room for my kid.  The room is tiny but clean. We do not have enough space to open my luggage. The bathroom is small with limited amenities.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"This hotel is very well situated. Next to the Dt21 mrt station, Taxi stand in front, walking distance to orchard street and bugis junctions, 7 eleven and toast box just annexed to it.

Next to the pool so just put your clothes to wash and enjor your time in the pool, then put them to dry.  Hotel resto is next door the Papas Resto  but the food is not so great for breakfast. Juice and cereals are not good. Cuttleries and plates are cracked. They need to change it. But for the price your paying you should expect this.  Else, as i said budget stay but still a good choice.

When i came back, the only thing different is that the glass has been washed and its on my bathroom upside down (like we are waiting for it to dry. That night also went terrible because i just realized that thereâs so many noises, from the aircon and refrigerator, from outside, from other rooms, even from the staffs going back and forth early in the morning.

If you also have more than one regular sized luggage you would find it difficult, as there is hardly space and the wardrobe is a single door wardrobe, that also houses the safe and small fridge. No power sockets at bedside as well. There did not seem to have an exhaust system in the toilet as well, which made it a challenege.",6,Jun-19,

V Hotel Bencoolen,I stayed here for 4 nights and found it to be perfectly located right on top of the Bencoolen railway station and with a variety of restaurants to choose from. As long as you have the railway line handy it doesn't really matter where you choose to stay in Singapore and there are plenty of restaurants & shopping centres all over the place. The hotel is non-descript from the front but it's easy to spot from the street. You don't come here to stay in a large luxurious suite but rather for a clean & functional room suitable to sleep and shower when you're not sightseeing. We stayed in a superior double room and it was very tight with only minimal room to walk around the bed and no space for luggage.

The walls of the hotel rooms are paper thin so all I could hear all night was doors slamming, people talking, coughing, arguing, shouting and the TV from other rooms. This went on late into the night/ early morning. I was awoken by more of the same. In Singapore for business I made the decision to check out and move to another hotel. After an initial reluctance, the next 2 nights of my planned stay was refunded.  Ok if you are in Singapore to party, but not if you are there to work and need sleep. ",4,Sep-19,

The walls are incredibly thin. We woke up one night thinking a man was in our room as somebody next door sneezed loudly. We could also hear conversations and noise from the lift announcement. Our room wasn't made up at all while we were there. We asked for it to be left on one morning but it wasn't done for either of the other mornings either.

The biggest inconvenience proved to be that the electricity goes out when you leave the room, so impossible to charge devices while out for dinner.  (Grr!)  They kindly gave me a late check out, which was very helpful given my schedule.  On the negative side, everything that went on in the halls could be heard in the room.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"Firstly, it was my confusion to mix up Village Hotel and V Hotel. But then, my confusion was really an eye opener with the experience. I've read some reviews that they received surprises from the hotel when they're celebrating their birthdays, but I am also surprised with what they have given me on my birthday stay. Not even a card, don't mention a cake, which I don't even bother.  The hotel, is really under the budget category. I was totally shocked when I went into the room. Pictures vs real room size, are total opposite! They can still use torn linen for your bed, check you in into a room which has leaking ceiling which will then soak all your vanity packs. The pictures will tell you the story.   TV channels don't work, except for those local channels from Mediacorp. If I'dâ¦",2,Oct-21,

Check in is very quick, professional and helpful staff, we were in our room very quickly. There is a washing machine and dryer for your convenience, this is the only hotel I have found that offers that. The pool area is beautiful and very well kept.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"Location, location, location - easy to take the MRT from the airport and pop up a few steps from the hotel. Several other mrt lines were only a few minutes walk away. I visited in February and they were taking your temperature before you entered and had to sign that you had not been to China recently.  I had a standard room which I was not surprised to be small, but if you opened your suitcase on the rack you could not get past it to the bathroom - very tight. I had a problem adjusting the AC and got it too hot and could not change it again. I left a note and they adjusted it back to the colder temp.  I did try the pool one afternoon, nice plants over the back balcony but the pool area itself is in an almost airshaft and very cold, not very inviting.",8,Feb-20,

Location is good central to Little India and Orchard Road, with MRT right next door. Some odd things - there were bath towels but no hand towels. First time I have been in a hotel where there was no difference between the facial tissues and toilet paper.

Bottled water at no extra cost daily. Henry was a delight. Very helpful on rainy days, days when carrying too much shopping and days when our feet were sore from walking and touring. Helpful with local knowledge and where to get the best deals. Would recommend.",10,Sep-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"First time we set foot in the hotel, Henry greeted us and assisted. The hotel has small lobby but cozy. The room is ok for Singapore and has private toilet & bath with amenities.  We had problem with our Singapore SIM but Henry helped us.  We went to Kuala Lumpur after 2 nights & they let us leave our big luggage in the hotel & retrieved when we came back. The hotel is also nearby the MRT ( right in its doorstep), near restaurants & walking distance to the night market). Nice thing is that they allowed us for late check out! Will definitely come back again to this hotel. ",10,Oct-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"I stay at V hotel Bencoolen in studio room. The hotel location is very close with Bencoolen MRT St and Bras Basah Mrt St. The room is clean, tidy. The service is very good. Henry is very helful. We will stay in this hotel again in our next vacation.",10,Oct-19,

V Hotel Bencoolen,"The rooms are on the small side, but clean and comfortable. The a/c was great but the bathroom a little compact ... at 6ft I felt like the Hulk trying to take a shower.  We had a 10th floor room with an amazing city skyline view.  The hotel is next door to the Bencoolen downtown MTR station. This line gets you to the airport and the bay front without changing lines.  If you plan to stay for 2 or more days use a tourist travel card. These can only be purchased from the airport, Chinatown and one other station.  For the location, price and cleanliness alone I would stay here again.",8,Sep-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"We found this hotel from traveloka. We decided to stay for 3 nights.   First, the location very strategic so close with MRT (Bencoolen Station) and close by from bus stop. No need to worry about transportation here  Second, the price is quite affordable for me, considering the location is strategic.   Last but not least, the room is comfy enough. Clean and tidy. Plus your Guest Service, Henry gave us a 5 star service.. Heâs kind and helpful.   Overall itâs a nice hotel to stay.",10,Sep-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,We booked a studio room that can fit 3 adults for one night during our stopover. The hotel is located above the bencoolen mrt and taxi stand is right in front of the hotel. There are many food options.  The room is clean but small for those who have many luggages. Check in and out are good. Cannot comments on the hotel breakfast as we did not have them.  Will definitely stay here again. ,10,Sep-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"Hotel V Bencoolen is located near Bencoolen and Bras Basah MRT Station, so easy to commute around Singapore. Food court and 7-11 is also near by, only a few steps away. Breakfast is served by Indian restaurant, located besides the hotel, although the food variety is not many. Warm welcome by Mr. Henry, who assist our luggage and explain some details. Although the room is very small, but next time if we visit Singapore, we would come back again to Hotel V Bencoolen.",8,Oct-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"Ok we did not quite believe the reviews about noise and paper thin walls but wish we had.  Our first night near the lifts was so disruptive hearing every conversation as partying people exited at 3.00am we had little sleep. Although we moved rooms to another floor away from the lift the walls were so thin we heard everything next door and across the hall - SMS messages on phones, internal phones ringing, the hair drier being used after 12.15am. Yes we did phone reception the third night about the hairdryer again at 12.45am but it only stopped briefly. The large tour groups leaving their doors open until all hours and talking kept us awake at night and exhausted by the morning.    Not recommended for people who need sleep. Will not stay here again.",4,Oct-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"Just spent 5 nights here. Hotel is in a great location right next door to Bencoolen MRT station. Singapore MRT and bus service is excellent and easy to navigate.  Arrived early around 11 am and to our very pleasant surprise we where able to check in, off to a great start.   The premier room, whilst on the small size was big enough for 2. Spotlessly cleaned everyday, clean bed sheets and towels each day. Walk in shower with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. We basically only showered and slept in the room as we where out and about most days.   There is a guest laundry on the third floor (inside the pool area) which we used once, this is a great idea. Didn't use the wifi.  All the staff in the hotel we met where friendly and willing to help, the 2 doormen get extraâ¦",8,Oct-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"Staff: Friendly staff especially Henry, he even insisted on showing us where Bugis is for cheap finds and cheap food. He even arranged for our taxi back to the airport and also offered us late check-out time for free. Thank you Henry for making our stay a pleasant one! Location: Nice location, the hotel is just beside Bencoolen MRT and a few minute walk from other MRT and bus station. FYI you may need to transfer lines/stations depending on where you go so plan your trip well.  Facilities: Clean rooms, sheets, towels, good water pressure, nice pool, quiet rooms. Room space is relatively small which I think is typical for the price we paid for the rooms. We got 2 triple rooms for a family of 6 adults and 1 child",10,Oct-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"the hotel location is good enough because it very close to MRT Station, which is very important for staying in singapore to reduce a transportation cost. also there is a food republic and a grocery which is close too. the things is the room of the hotel is small, but the hotel is mention the size of the room during booking or choosing a room. if traveling with a kids it's not recommended to stay in standard room at this hotel, because the room will be full with the luggage. the room have about 50-70 cm space between bed and wall. and for couple it just enough.",8,Sep-19,

V Hotel Bencoolen,Location is convenient for Bencoolen MRT station but I was very unimpressed with the room and it was not good value compared to similar priced properties in that area that I have stayed at on previous visits.  The room (even being an upgraded larger room) was miniscule and poorly laid out. It was set up for 3 people but I can't imagine 3 people could comfortably stay in the space.  One bed was squished up against the window so that the floor length curtains couldn't close properly (annoying when being woken by light in the morning).  The worst part was the appalling smell which was like a bad cheap soap of overpowering floral which I think was being pumped through the aircon. Made me want to gag every time I entered the room and took a while to get used to each time I returnedâ¦,4,Nov-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"Excellent location, right next to MRT with a number of bars/restaurants within walking distance.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"My Wife and I stayed at the V Hotel Bencoolen in December for 6Days. The bed was very comfortable and room was small but suited the purpose as we were out and about most of the time. I quite liked the tall windows in the room, it had a decent view as well. The Hotel staff is very attentive, they are so attentive that within 5 minutes your request is done. Henry was the first person we met checking-in and was very helpful and gave us lots of tips to visit, as it was the season, and most importantly he is always with a smile which you rarely see in Singapore.   The Hotel is situated in a convenient location, MRT, BUS, Restaurants and it is central to Orchard and Bugis..",6,Dec-19,

Special mention and thanks to Henry for going out of his way to help us get settled in and make sure we were comfortable. Also recommended some good food spots. Very friendly staff. Would stay here again on our next visit to SG.,8,Jan-20,
V Hotel Bencoolen,Stayed as we camefor New Yearâs Eve prior to a cruise for 6 days. The standard rooms are very small if staying for more than a couple of days so we upgraded to a deluxe room they are the same size but you get an outside balcony which was ideal for somewhere to sit and store luggage.  All hotel staff exceptional and we were given a complimentary early check in and late checkout due to the timings of our flights and our length of stay. Henry and John the porters both helpful.   Do not use papas kitchen for breakfast either use 30 bencoolen hotel next door for well priced western style breakfast or the food republic at the end of the street for very good value Asian style food for breakfast lunch or dinner.  Other places to eat are Chijmes complex 7 min walk - Harryâs bar orâ¦,8,Jan-20,

V Hotel Bencoolen,"You canât beat this hotelâs location. Same block as Bencoolen MRT station and walking distance to Bugis shopping area, SGâs bargain shopping hub.

The hotelâs WiFi is super fast so you wonât have any issues connecting to the internet to share your moments after a long day of sightseeing.   Henryâs superb  service is tough to beat.

The best thing about our stay was that the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful at any given time of the day! We were even given the option to check-in early! Downside of the hotel was that the rooms were not spacious at all.,8,Oct-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"For me and my family, this hotel is perfect, especially for moslem tourists like us. The hotel location is right in front of  Bencoolen Mosque and they provide halal foods for breakfast.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"My parents and I arrived here Xmas eve and stayed for two nights. We chose the location to be close to the church for midnight mass on Xmas day/night. The location is good, right on top of MRT, walking distance to everything (we walked to Orchard Rd, the Padang, Raffles, Bugis st etc) but the rooms are extremely small. We had a family room (double bed with a single bed up in a loft) and there was literally nowhere to place a suitcase. We couldnât walk past each other and had to navigate taking turns getting past each other to do anything. The bathroom was not clean (when the steam covered the mirror you could see the previous guests had written words on it) particularly around the toilet seat. We ended up purchasing a toilet roll from the 7-11 as there was only facial tissueâ¦",6,Dec-19,

Easy to get to the airport too. We had 3 people in our room and the room was incredibly small, had to put one of our suitcases on the stairs.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"We stayed here for 3 nights in December. The hotel is conveniently closely located nearby the Bencoolen MRT station at the Down Town line. From the airport it will take you approx. 1 hour by MRT or 20 mins by taxi/Gojek. In the vicinity you can find a convenience store, bars and other activities.  The staff was very attentive, they arranged a surprise birthday cake for my girlfriend! Very nicely done by the (general) manager, they even offered it free-of-charge though I ordered it with them. Very kind gesture which we truly appreciated!  Rooms as mentioned by others are indeed rather small, but same as in Hong Kong where space is rather limited with many skyscrapers it will do.  Would definitely stay here again.",10,Dec-19,

V Hotel Bencoolen,"Let's be clear, our room would need to have been twice as large to qualify as small, it was truly tiny. We paid AUD285 for two nights here through Agoda. The hotel is very easy to get to from Changi Airport. With an MRT card take the train one stop to Expo Station and change to the blue downtown line to Bencoolen Station. Take the exit to the right, not the one towards Bras Basah Road. The hotel is beside the MRT station. The hotel is in an excellent location. Check in was swift, the room was clean and had a safe, mini fridge, tea making, free wifi and flat screen television. The bed was firm but had a mattress topper.

V Hotel Bencoolen,"While the hotel rooms is fairly decent, I urge your management to look into the quality of the food served for breakfast. If I can compare it, it is worse than the food quality meant for Animals.   Let me tell you why... you are serving fake corn flakes, where when mixed with beverage, it hardens. Fish fillet which is made out of flour. The only edible food was the eggs and bread. Coffee was at its worst. Taste more like drain water than coffee......   Please do not serve humans, and I think animals will also avoid these food quality. ",2,Dec-19,
V Hotel Bencoolen,"The hotel is in a good location, just outside the city centre (about 15 minutes on foot), in a quiet area served by the metro and public transport. The rooms are tiny, when I arrived the room was dirty, very dirty; I noticed it at the reception and they cleaned it, improving the situation but not solving the problem. It's a 2 star hotel (no more as far as I'm concerned) and sincerely even if Singapore is a very expensive city, to pay over 100 â¬ (excluding breakfast) for a night in this structure seems to me a total madness.",4,Dec-19,

Reception was friendly and about what you would expect from a place like this. Located right next door to the Metro station with a couple of others less than 5 minute walk.   Strange layout. All the rooms around a central square so that any room on the inside faces every other room in the quad. Corridors are pokey and the doors spaced so close together gives you a sense of what is about to happen when you open them.   Inside. There is about a foot of space between the bed and the walls.

They changed me to another room after much arm twisting.  3) Most of the rooms have strong musty smell which is very unpleasant.  So I have now given up on this hotel.",6,27-Jul-19,

For starters, the Robots down for the entire 6 night stay so had to collect everything we needed from reception, not the worst thing to ever happen but as a hotel that sells the whole robot experience, we felt let down by this. Add watered down soap and no robes in our room also among other things and we really started to question the money we spent. Not an experience all will have Iâm sure, but unfortunately what we had.

If you sleep on the side, it sinks down like a pillow and you are sleeping on a slant. It only works if you are single and sleeping in the middle of the bed.   The service is horrible. The people are unfriendly, donât speak and could care less. When I complained about the bed, the lady offered another bed (which was exactly the same) in another room, or to put a wooden board under the bed.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"We had a great time at Yotel! It's conveniently located along Orchard road near the big malls. Just a 4-5 minute walk from the train station. The rooms we had were nicely sleek and modern. The beds were super comfy especially after a long day of walking. Our rooms were adjoined, so it's an added bonus for us. Expect the rooms to be a bit cramped though; but everything you might need in a hotel room is there. Will surely consider Yotel again when we're back in Singapore :)",10,Sep-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"While the location was good, the first impression of the hotel was horrible as I met with staff seated in-front dressed in a brown coat. He was rude and unhelpful when approached. I tried asking him about baggage storage as I arrived earlier than the check-in time. Without listening to my concern, he brushed me off and gave an unwarranted response by saying, ""early check-in is SGD100"". Was this really necessary when the customer was not even requesting for that? That left such a horrible first impression on the hotel. Indeed, during check-out, he came by and snapped to rush the process when there were no one else doing check out. He acted as if the customer should by heart know the steps to perform self check out without even reading the screen. Please train or improve theâ¦",2,Sep-22,

The room was clean and served its purpose great, it is however a bit small. Our balcony on the highest level had a fantastic view especially at night. The pool was great for a swim after walking around all day, nothing spectacular but nice, and the cocktails from Komunity bar were also nice and not too expensive. The staff were also very helpful, helped with check in, kept our bags stored away on day of check out (as our flight was late at night) and organised a taxi whenever needed! ",8,Sep-22,

Robots are used by the hotel to bring all necessary items to your room.   Pro: Excellent location because it is near Orchard Road.   Cons: There aren't many alternatives for breakfast at the hotel, which may be improved.  - The room is cramped and undersized.   Overall, a pleasant stay",6,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Very reasonably priced hotel (given its location in Orchard). Bed was extra comfy, room is clean, service is good. Main necessaries are covered. Would have been nice to have more consistent internet access though (we couldnt get wifi access when the network was busy!). Even then well worth the price tag. Would stay here again! Good bang for your buck!",8,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),The location was right for me due to the business reason. Every inch of space inside the room (cabin) was very well-thought & useful. Don't forget to use the service from the robot for bottles of water or an extra towel you may need. The sound proofing quality is poor though you can hear your next door or people walking-by easily.,10,Jul-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Great location, right in the center of Singapore, the facilities is great, easy to check in, but the bed is too soft, not supporting my backbones, and also they clean the room every 4 days, that's too long!! need to improved. ",6,May-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Excellent location. Rooms small but everything you need is there. Clean. No noise at all considering how compact the rooms are. Great space using ideas.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Love the soft and comfy bed. The adjustable bed allows you to adjust according to your preference. Each guest is also given two pillows. Nice place for a staycay to relax with cute, smart robots. Staff were friendly. Overall good experience.",8,May-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),I stayed at this hotel and they took a deposit from my debit card. I called back to ask about the reversal because it has been more than a month now and they one person says the reversal cant be done on a debit card i had to collect cash when i checked out and i was then transferred to a girl who is very rude and she said they reversed the transaction but she cant provide the proof and then she ended up hanging up on me..  This is very unprofessional,2,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),I checked out after two days after finding out that there is no room cleaning service ... after asking for my room to be cleaned after a long day walking and expecting to get back to a nice clean room and a made bed i found my bed unmade and half drunk coffee and empty water bottles still in the room at 5pm ... when i called for the room to be cleaned they suggested that  i might want more water but were reluctant to mention that the rooms will not be cleaned until after the fourth night stay . This had been addressed on a note  in the room which went unread as I had imagined it was the usual please hang the towels etc to0 save water ....... I really feel it is essential to tell guests what to expect and allow guests the option to book alternative accommodation if this does notâ¦,2,May-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Stayed at the First Class King Room and it was very convenient. The view and the ambience light were great. However the bed wasn't as comfy as it looks like since it can be reclined, I ended up sleeping with the bed reclined a bit because I felt a gap of the bed when it was full flat bed. However, it was a good stay. ",10,May-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Yotel is ideally located in the centre of the city with easy access to MRT, Shopping Malls, Bus Stops etc. Breakfast at Kommunity is sumptuous, alluring and delicious. A small suggestion is that the room size is extremely small. The balcony is converted into Bathroom, albeit a novel idea, but causes inconvenience to guests. Washbasin in bed room  results spilling of water to bed. This type of room is good for single guest; not to be allotted to couple with children.   ",10,May-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"The hotel is situated right in the city centre of Orchard Road. So, if you are looking to stay around Orchard, this hotel would be a good fit. From the hotel, you can walk to a few malls such as Isetan, Tangs, ION Orchard etc. There are underground passes, so rain or sunshine, you will be okay. The Orchard MRT is also nearby so you can take the train to many places of interest. Very convenient.",8,May-22,

And just stated in the check in process that will no daily cleaning for 3 nights. It is a new regulation that it was not stated when you booked the room.   The robot often being broke down so that when you need something in the room, it take for a long time to send.  The gym was not good as well. Static bike and elliptical was broken.

It is a couple of minutes walk through a short connected shopping mall to Orchard Road and only another 100 metres to the Shaw Centre at the corner of Orchard and Scotts Roads from where you can easily access shopping and the MRT. The bed was a motorised type that can be raised from about half of its length or dropped down flat. The facilities are compact but perfectly fine for most short term trips. The shower and toilet were next to a full-length clear glass wall with a view of the nearby buildings - meaning they can see you too - so there are two built-in blinds to give either partial or total screening. During the day, the partial screen lets light in and you can see through from inside, but anyone looking in from nearby buildings couldâ¦",8,Jun-22,

Bed had an automatic uplift at the back and that was quite nice as I could watch the TV while sitting up straight. Had quite a few nice channels on the TV so I watched a few movies. Bed was also extremely soft, so I could roll around it and enjoy how fluffy it was. Location was excellent, it was just 5 to 10mins from Orchard mrt station. I managed to buy McDonald's and brought it back to my hotel room. Unfortunately, there was no table or chair so I could only eat on the bed. Toilet was very cool and had a nice large window outside.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),The room is very small. But great location on Orchard road.  We have stayed here for many times and were quite happy earlier. But this time the new policy is applied: The hotel donât clean up the room in 4 days.  We donât accept that quality of service. We even asked a female staff to clean up my room and change the towels but she refused very rudely.  I am so disappointed. ,6,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Overall experience was good. The check in was okay. We had to use the self check in but needed the staff's help anyway cos it wasnt working well. But the staff was very helpful and on the ball. Room was clean enough and tidy. ,10,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"First the positives: location is excellent at the junction between Orchard and Scotts Road. Plenty of shopping and dining options. Wifi was fast and while there were a lot of rooms, the number of lifts was enough that there was not much waiting to go up or down to the room levels. TV had the usual cable channels covering news and info, movies and entertainment. Now the not so good points: room is small, if you have several pieces of luggage you may have little room to move left. There is no place to sit or work unless you used the luggage rack as a workaround bench. Cleaning is not done daily. We stayed 4 days and the rooms were never cleaned. I don't mind that so much but the trash bin in the room is small and fills up fast. Even if you left it in the hallway, it is not pickedâ¦",8,May-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Great location and modern looking hotel. Rooms are with high ceilings and a balcony.

There is no housekeeping during my 3 days 2 nights stay even when I book two King rooms. I felt that at least they should bother to help guests clear their trashbins. The sofa bed was creaking throughout the night if you move. Pretty uncomfortable. Main bed was good but a tad soft.  I love the Komiyumti restaurant as staff was nice, friendly and polite.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Can't actually fault anything about the Hotel other than the room was too small but what should I have expected - it was called a Pod - and I can see why. The view from the bathroom was great and the bed very comfortable however I needed to do a fair bit of work on my laptop and there was absolutely no where to do this in the room - I had to go down to the Bar on level 10 to have any room at all. It was definately worth trying but I would happily pay a fair bit more to stay in a larger room next time. I was the only person in the room - if there had been two of us I would have just left and asked for a refund.,6,May-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"I would definitely stay here again. Good location in town and affordable rooms. The walls seem quite thick cuz I canât hear any noise from the other rooms.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Clean pad, but itâs ideal for people who want to spend the whole day out and come back to a clean room to crash in because of how small it is.   The service at front desk was unhelpful as the staff we dealt with was new and didnât communicate well even when asked simple questions like, âWhatâs the problem?â when they were experiencing difficulties with our check-out process. So that was a little frustrating.   The breakfast included in our stay was nice.   We enjoyed our stay overall. ",8,May-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"The hotel location and bed are superb, unfortunately, the cleaning service is a bit wierdly bad. They clean your room only once every 3 days, which means you have to ask for extra bottles of drinking water for the 2nd and 3rd day, you need to tidy up your room yourself, you have to ask for new paper cup for coffee and clean your rubbish bin yourself. Consider this as room for rent instead of a hotel. Even worst this thing happen during pandemic time.",4,Jul-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Stayed in Yotel Orchard from 8-10 July 2022. Stayed in 2428. I get the self check in , robot delivers cold food to the room etc I could not get for receptionist to say âwe clean the rooms only after 3 daysâ. In a post pandemic period where cleaning is crucial , not cleaning the rooms was funny. Funnier is they do not advertise it anywhere especially during booking. Certainly I would not book a hÃ´tel where cleaning is not a priority  Other than that all was okay",8,Jul-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"They donât clean your room, u less you specifically ask them to, which given how much you pay for the room is poor. Also, for a cool hotel they still provide water in single use plastic bottlesâ¦. Not ok anymore.",6,Jul-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),I had a nice stay in both Yotel locations; Jewel and Orchad. Love the experience and they way they do things differently. We have all the essential that we need while travel. The location is also great.  2 best things are Bed and the Robots!,10,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Great location, room is small but not a problem for solo traveller. Very clean, however you only get your room cleaned once every 3 days. Love that the room is bright and modern. Not a fan of the electric adjustable folding bed so I had it flat the whole time ( 8 Days). My most favourite is the shower room. No waste amenities are great. You get 2 large bath towels, no hand or face towel but I'm fine with that.",10,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Very nice hotel to stay, close to shops & mrt station. Sofa bed is really not comfortable with thin foam mattres without pillow,bedsheet/blanket.   Other than that it will be a superb & convenient hotel to stay",8,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"We booked this trip through a travel agent as part of an overall package and didnât realise just how intimate the room would be! Thereâs only a glass divide between the bathroom and bedroom. If you were on your on or potentially with a partner it may be fine, but we were friends sharing. The room smells like damp as the bathroom is a wet room and thereâs no extractor fan or window that opens.  Overall the hotel is fine, parts of the room are well done, others could do with improvement like sockets and a shelf on both sides of the bed, and a shelf for your clothes in the bathroom as itâs one big wet room.  Currently only clean the room every 3 days as well which isnât great. ",6,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Second time here and it was just as pleasant. Location is good, cleanliness and comfort of the room is good, service is also good. Rooms are not exactly very spacious but the First Class Queen was sufficient for 2 pax. Though we do wish that there was a table for us to eat from instead of having to put our food on the bed. But overall, a pleasant experience. ",10,Jun-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Hotel is nice and clean, location is excellent. Rooms are small but still comfortable. Staffs are friendly and accommodating.   We had an issue with the lock on our room, I had to go down the lobby to have the key fixed but ultimately the door did not open and we had to transfer rooms. It was a little bit of hassle because we were already tired from the tour and we still had to pack and change rooms. but the staff handled the situation nicely.   Bed is too soft or maybe worn out already. When you lie down the mattress flattens and does not hold shape, so for me who is used to sleeping on a semi firm mattress it was a little uncomfortable.   Also, they do not make up the room unless you request it.   But overall, stay was pleasant and a cool experience with the robots. Locationâ¦",6,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Fantastic place to stay and you can hardly find a hotel that is so cost effective especially in orchard road area.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"We stayed in this hotel recently in our visit to Singapore. This is located in the middle of the Orchard shopping area. Location is very convenient for travelers who enjoy food, shopping and may be a movie.  Our room was in a higher floor and with the glass faÃ§ade in the toilet, the view was amazing. However, when we actually do the business in the toilet we had to close it with the curtain (for obvious reasons like privacy).    The food is also reasonably good. We only had the breakfast (Buffet) and it was good.  Although the buffet was not very big, it had a good set of options. They were good in flavor too.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"I stayed here for 1 night and was thankful it was only for 1 night. The rooms were very small, like the average size of a Hong Kong hotel room small. Ironically, with the same price I can get a bigger hotel room in HK. There was barely enough room to walk around the room with the TV so close to the bed once the reclining bed (similar to beds in the hospital) is placed down. There isn't a proper door know to the toilet, it's just a little stub that extends from the glass for you to grab. The bathroom sink is right next to the bed.  There were ants crawling on the wall. The bed was ridiculously soft too, like once you lied down it would be difficult to get up. I believe it gave me a bad back too. The shower and toilet is integrated, therefore the toilet and floor will be wet afterâ¦",2,Jun-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"I would not recommend this hotel for business traveler. The room was too small, I could reach the door from the bed on this end.. and the wash room was on step on the other end. On the front less than a step was the TV. I had no desk or chair. ",4,Jun-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"The room was so small that it was difficult for two people to maneuver and hard to deal with luggage.  Since there was no place to really store anything, we had to live out of our suitcases, but there was really no place to put them.  There is only one ""nightstand"" as the sink is on the other side of the bed in the room.  And there is one wet area that houses both the toilet and shower.  If you check out early, they still charge you for not giving 48 hour notice.   Felt like it was more like a hostel than a hotel room.  It did have a safe and refrigerator and excellent TV selection but those items did not make up for the ridiculously small size.",4,Jun-22,

It is good that the bed is adjustable to either a sleeping or sitting position but do take note that because of this, the bed has a sunken point (at the point of bending) when bed is in sleeping position.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Overall the experience in Yotel is wonderful. It is clean and I had no issues with the room.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Yotel is akin to a shoebox apartment at 14sqm. It is not exactly a staycay property to lust after but for convenience, it is smacked right in the middle of Orchard Road. I wasnt having high expectations so I did enjoyed the cozy cabins for 3 nights anyway ï",6,Nov-21,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Staff wasn't attentive enough requested for 2 additional bath towels to only received 2 bottled water instead.  Staff was talking to safe entry near the door and was left waiting at the check in area for about 3 mins before service.  Mini fridge servicing was bad which didn't made it cold at all. Tech just disengage the cupboard door with the fridge door and told me it will be cool after leaving it for awhile which I left it for 6 hours earlier. Not helpful at all.  Calling of control room, will take ages at times with no one picking up had to call multiple times just to get through.   Air conditioner was bad had to wake up every few hours to jumpstart the controls to ensure the room was cold again which affects the quality of sleep.  Overall, an ideal location and clean placeâ¦",6,Mar-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"While this hotel has a fantastic location, the hotel is not interested in catering for families.  When we booked our two rooms, I requested interconnecting rooms.  When we arrived at check in, I specified again that we wanted interconnecting rooms. The guy said he couldnât tell yet if they were interconnecting. He rushed us through the whole check in process - when I asked again when he handed us the keys, he said he didnât know if they were interconnecting. When we got to our rooms, we found that they werenât interconnecting.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Had a pleasant 2 nights stay, like the strategic location, near to mrt and surrounded by all the malls with easy access.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Cute hotel with the robot food delivering room service and the amazing staff.  The only downside of the rooms was the motion sensors installed to conserve electricity.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Nice place. Nice environment. Decent food and drinks. just the compact space of the room not really to my liking. overall is a decent and comfortable stay.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Very cool and technologically advanced but not for families. I would book it again it if I was travelling alone or with a partner but not when a big group or with a family.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"You cant have a better location than this as it is just 2 mins walk to orchard road.  However, the room was absolutely trash. The room was so dirty that we found cockroach in the room (as shown in the photo, there is a Yotel sticker on the switch to prove this was indeed taken in Yotel). This is also the first hotel I have ever been that does not provide housekeeping service. There is a ""please make up my room"" button but the room was not cleaned throughout our 4D3N stay.  Also, the gimmicky bed was a hell for anyone with a spine. The mattress was so soft that when the it was flattened down (there is a switch for you to elevate the head of the bed), it became a C shaped mattress. This was literally worse than lying on the ground, which was not an option due to the limited spaceâ¦",2,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Found this hotel from google and decided to try it out, it was worth it. The staff are quite helpful, especially the robots. They're super adorable.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"My stay with my mum was great, Room was clean and bed is quite small but ok for petite size. TV channels quite a number of choices. Venue was very convenient to travel around in Orchard area, many places for foods.",8,Mar-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Did a solo staycation in the Premium Cabin with view, and found the room to very cost and perfect for a single guest looking to spend time alone. Location was tucked behind International Building which kind of hid the hotel but signs from outside was adequate to guide anyone from Orchard MRT to the hotel. In-room equipment were good although the bed could be a little firmer for more comfort, though its understandable due to the reclining aspect of the bed which causes a sunken, deep crease when you recline it fully into a bed. FOX channels on the TV guide should be updated, and the hotel should enable mobile-to-tv cast via same wifi other than the Miracast and screen mirroring (via an app) option. All things considered, for two nights for a solo guest, it was a worthwhile stay.",8,Mar-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"The beds were comfy and the room was very clean. However, the service needs improvement. I tried to order the room service, got on the call, and called 2 - 3 times. Took about atleast 20 min. Yet no one picked up. Please improve on that. ",6,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"The best deal in Singapore so far, perfect location for best price.. its easy to mrt station, close to Clark Quay and orchard road. The staff are helpfull. The room is sparkling clean. The room size is more than enough for 2 persons",10,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),I really like how the hotel looks very futuristic. Cleanliness of the hotel room was what I liked the most. Paid extra for the view and it was worth it. Made a special request for the robot to sing Happy Birthday for my boyfriend and it did happen that was really enjoyable. I love the cabin guide on the television. Really good customer service - they sent a messaging saying that we can check in as early as 7am but due to work we were not able to. Overall a good and memorable stay.,8,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Chose this hotel due to many considerations. 1. Not operating as a SHN hotel. 2. Value for money. 3. Location. 4. Previous good experiences when staying at this hotel.   Check-in done using self-service terminal. There are plus and flip sides.  Plus â no queues.  Flip â Somewhat impersonal.  Itâs (Komyuniti) bar and restaurant still serve the same menu as last year. Perhaps a change is due? ,10,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Due to covid-19 but Yotel keep everything really good. The location is okay but hard to find on 1st time. Breakfast , staff, cabin so good. The check in fast  The robot Yoshi and Yolanda aren cute and helful ",8,Apr-22,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"It was a great check in experience at YOTEL with their self service kiosk, although the applet would have problems with the face recognition.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Service crew was great, nice hotel rooms, comfy beds, wonderful views and proximity to many malls and restaurants.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Nice place to stay.  Nice & cool environment. It would be nice to provide bathrobes in the cabin for guest to use after shower or after using the pool in the terrace area. Great location in heart of a famous shopping strip. The Cable tv service need to have more Sports selection like Epl channel, NBA F1 racing etc..",8,Apr-22,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),I never recommend this property as a 4 start hotel. The rooms are very small and difficult to accommodate to adults in the room. The wash rooms are also smelly as there was no ventilation provided. You can also hear the sound of other water flows and thereby the feeling you get that you live inside the wash room.   The Bed arrangement is terrible as all the beds in the hotel are folding beds. Therefore you cannot have a comfortable sleep.   The Breakfast was absolutely disastrous as there was no buffet. Even the alacarte menu has no choice and had to experience the same menu for 6 days. ,2,Apr-22,

I thought with COVID situation, they will change the regulation of the daily cleaning, but no, they still clean every 3 days, so its kind of the downside for us especially that we're staying quite long.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Small yet clean room, with efficient check in and check out experience. I'll always recommend Yotel for its convenient location!

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"The hotel is not as good as i thought it'd be and not as expected from the review and rating that ive seen about this hotel. 1. it is not direct access to the nearby mall nor mrt station nkr from Groud Floor although there's a lift provided but it is so slow and it can only carry uo to 4 to 5 person at max at a time which means you will choose to walk the stairs most of the time to avoid waiting. Location-wise is still accepted as it is closely located to Orchard Road, MRT statiom and bus stops. The check in and out needs to be done via the kiosk which you will expect is a seamless and contactless experience yet while the check in via the kiosk is fast and easy, however the waiting for a staff to come over to validate the document is long. At last, it js the bedding that is terrified. The bedding is not comfortable at all. We have a back pain after stayinh at this hotel.",6,7-Jan-20,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Everything was disappointing.

Wi-Fi was spotty. The signal keeps dropping and connecting.

Cleanliness of the room - Not clean at all.
The towels had black flakes IN them. Same black flakes in the toilet bowl - had to flush a few times before they went away. The toilet bowl had oil (?) stains at the side. The switches have DIRTY fingerprints. The small table had watermarks on them. The bedsheets were stained. The mugs and cups had fingerprints. And a whole lot of things that I turned a blind eye to.

Housekeeping
I ignored the stains on the bedsheet and slept the 1st night cos I was exhausted. The next day, while my room was tidied up, the sheets were not changed. I called to get them to help me change the sheets again. I left the room and when I came back, the bed incline was changed but THE SHEETS WERE NOT CHANGED. I called conceirge to give my feedback, the person listened but did not ask for my room number (no, they dont know what room I am in). No follow-up or apology.

Motion Sensor
Lights and air conditioning are controlled by motion sensors. Nothing new. But this is the 1st time that I have lights switching off while I was showering. On top of that, the lights and aircon switched off while I was sleeping. I woke up several times sweating and to get the motion sensor to work.

Fridge was not working. Bought milk and it spoilt cos the fridge wasn't cold enough. Had diarrhoea cos I drank a sip of said milk w/o checking.",4,9-Dec-19,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Very small room for 2 person,not enough space to move for 2 persons,that make us disappointed.Small lobby, very crowded during our check out,where in the same time so many people waiting for free room to check in,it was not convenient for the guests.Good is the selfservice check in and check out,which need only very short time due to the easy process.There are 6 lift available,but always needed long waiting time due to the small capacity and too many guests.",6,1-Jan-20,

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Cleanliness, tidy with helpful staff. You could gain the best experience during your stay. I recommend this place if you are going to SG.",10,20-Nov-19,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),"Overall if you consider Yotel hotel as a 2 star hotel with good location you would not be disappointed. But to claim this is a 4 star is a far stretch. 
Some floors have rooms with such poor sound isolation that you can hear not only what your neighbours are you to, but the whole floor. 
The amneties are minimal and quite low quality. 
Changed towels were dirty with stains, yet they were folded as new ones. 
You can turn the aircon off but the room will still get cold air form the hallway, so if you're cold, you better get dressed. 
Elevators are packed and you can stand in the lobby in line to the elevators for about 10 minutes till your turn gets to get cramped into an elevator. 
The gym is quite interesting. It can accommodate about 4 people after which it will be impossible to move around in. So you have to wait till.people leave before you can enter and try to use the equipment. The actual equipment isn't bad but the lack of it and space is disturbing. 
Service is pretty much useless. You have self check in machines that still require you to seek a front desk personnel to verify items and complete check in. Something which makes the whole process obsolete. 
Besides that the personnel isn't very helpful all together so please try to avoid interactions. 

If this was a 2 star hotel I guess it would be a cool 2 star one. But again Yotel claims it a 4 star, and I don't see how this even possible with such major flaws. 

Overall suggest you to find alternatives around",4,20-Nov-19,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),The hotel rooms are too small for comfort. Pictures from the web are not really reflective of the real size of the room. Not recommended for travellers who are looking to be able to move around freely in their hotel rooms. Windows or the way to sunlight is through the toilet / bathroom.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Amazing good & Comfortable ,10,5-Dec-19,
YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),My stay was for an extended weekend getaway that turned into a week stay due to my departure flight being cancelled because of a storm. Extended thru hotels.com the hotel staff easily and quickly made sure that I continue get the same room.  My first room had some leaks in the bathroom coming from the room above.  They immediately moved me to another room and gave me free breakfast.  Wanted to get 2 though but 1 is good enough I guess :-) Breakfast area called Komyuniti is great.  Well lit. Loved the automatic/robotic omelet maker.  Food was good and had some variety from day to day. Loved the fact that Yoshi and Yolanda served as our butler (robots) when we needed extra towels or extra water.  Lobby could be slightly bigger coz it seemed like its a dorm or an apartment complex when full.  Bar is good for a late night drink.  Needed for it to be open at a later time though.  But it was good. How I wish they were consistent with their garnishes for my gin tonic.  Hotel has direct access to Orchard Rd and all its amenities. So its quite convenient.  Room is SMALL.  I was hesitant at first because of its size.  Actually it works.  The size IS functional.  I could use a little more space for my big luggage to be spread out but since I was alone in my cabin I did not mind. Room is functional but may need 2 beds if I go with family.  Internet was very quick.  and the view from the shower?  Impressive.  If only I was an exhibitionist I would have taken full advantage! :-) ,10,6-Dec-19,

No daily housekeeping, had to clear your own garbage and leave it outside the door. Had to request daily for the complimentary bottled water, only interesting part is the robots will deliver it to your room. Bed is too soft and uneven but still acceptable for a few nights. No staff to help you with luggage or greet you at the lobby. Hotel is clean, modern looking and looks new. Location is fantastic with eateries and amenities just few minutes away. Check out was fast.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road (SG Clean),Was offered early check in so that was a good start to the stay. Room was atypical to yotel chain of hotels.

My request for a late check out was flatly decline even after explaining that it was for my son to swim as it has been raining the whole day. Would appreciate a little sympathy. Some human touch is needed which sadly even the hotel's crewbots has.,8,22-Nov-20,

My son LOVED this room and would probably stay for a week, but 2 nights would be my personal limit as an adult haha. Room service was limited to call & pick up, but you're in the middle of Orchard which has TONS of dining and entertainment options via Shaw Centre and Ion Orchard.

I had to keep trying and did finally got someone to pick up at my 4th attempt.

Another staff worthy of mention would be Mary at Extension #0. When I called to order cakes, she took the trouble to find out what cakes were available at the cafe and advised me to make a trip downstairs as there was a promotion of 1-for-1 .

I am a muslim and im happy to have a muslim member having to serve us and told us nicely what can be eaten and what not from the menu. I really appreciate that. I would surely come back for another stay. No doubt on that.  The only thing that disappoint me was the fruit platter. Didnt expect it to be one whole orange and two whole apples uncut served on a plate. Hahaha. Other than that, all was great.",8,Dec-20,
York Hotel Singapore,"We got a free room upgrade, which was nice. The size of the room was massive and beds were comfortable.

York Hotel Singapore,"Though the location is probably ok (a bit of a walk to orchard road), the facilities in this hotel were not up to any standard.  Bathroom very mouldy and dirty., and a very high bath you have to step over to get into the shower.  Very dangerous for my elderly mother to access  Bedrooms boring and in need of a makeover , hard beds.  The breakfast buffet is very ordinary - not a lot of variety and the things they do have there run out with out being restocked for a long time.  they also have a menu to order hot breakfast items from.  Again not a lot of variety.  and quite often when receiving these hot meals, they were delivered to us cold,  ",2,Mar-20,

York Hotel Singapore,"The foyer, restaurant and possibly the 'premium' areas are of a very good standard.  However, the 'ordinary' rooms desperately need upgrading.  Our room was as clean as it could be, but with old bathroom tiles on the wall and floors and only a tiny steam vent, mould has ingrained itself in edges and corners and on the ceiling. The bathroom amenities provided were good.  The bedroom itself was clean but the carpet was very worn with a hole in at least one place. The headboard afixed to the wall rattled when I turned over.  The aspect ratio on the TV probably needs adjusting because if the programme had subtitles, only the top half of the words could be seen.

The management swapped our room and provided complimentary breakfast and late checkout for the third night.

Unexceptional to view on arrival, the foyer is however quite lovely.  They did not disappoint with exceptionally large, well appointed rooms. The bathroom was however, very small which was a shame. Some pictures on other reviews appear to be of updated suites. Given there was next to no one in the hotel, it would have been nice to be given one of these rooms.

York Hotel Singapore,A very good staycation experience for the family and kids as we missed travelling so getting the opportunity to have a short staycation is a good way to unwind and most importantly the hotel is a stone throw away from orchard / town where you can go shopping as well or you can have a swim with the family at the pool which is big enough to fit 3 families.

We loved the bathroom, which was equally as spacious and neat. We also had the buffet breakfast at White Rose Cafe, the food was served rather slowly due to (from I observed) the cafe being understaffed, but the food was great.

Similar to my first time, the lift lobby on the level of my room smelled like cigarettes the moment you stepped in. The walls were also very thin so I could hear my neighbours yelling after midnight, and them slamming their front doors shut in the morning and evening. As a result, my rest was severely disrupted.   Other than that, they had a maintenance power shutdown from midnight to 4am and only informed me a few hours before.

Teach your staff to  respect guests, practically every staff talked loudly and  some even openly bitched about others guests  among themselves.  Service was zero during Breakfast even though the place was quite empty.  Their attitude was really unacceptable as I had never encountered such terrible service , treating me & my gfs like  delinquents, bringing our food orders and cutleries  with their dirty gloved up hands to the table without serving trays. We had to sanitise the cutleries before use. Do you guys seriously look into the safety &  hygiene practice during COVID ? While we're eating ,a lady started to run the vacuum cleaner.

I came back in a taxi alone with 3 kids in tow. The moment I went out of the taxi, nobody came to assist me. The hotel staff just stood at the lobby smiling at me without even bother to assist. I had to take my stroller and few shopping bags from the taxi. Hence all my 3 young kids already ran to the lobby. I had to scream at them to wait for me(still the hotel staff stood there looking at us).  On the second day, my husband called for make-up room as we are leaving the hotel for a few hours.

Reminded me of American hotels with porcelain flooring, wide lobby, dim lights, and a long reception counter.  Check-in was fuss-free and we were delighted to know that we were given a free upgrade to the family suite, however, we had an extra bed and didn't know what to do with it as it was just the two of us HAHA so we ended up using it as a bed to sit on for when we returned from outdoors (when we did not want to shower yet).

Not sure if I imagined it, but the kettle seem to boil water faster than other hotels' kettles.

I was given a ready clean non smoking room and an offer for a room change to smoking room later because it was not ready upon our arrival in the morning. I was really surprised and appreciative.

York Hotel Singapore,my 1st time stay here...check in was alright. just that...the staff took awhile to search for an available room for us. eventually she got assisted by her manager.    They do not have any special arrangement/room decor or any complimentary cake for your special occasion (e.g. birthdays). so need not request on that.   Room is quite spacious although you can see the condition is quite old looking but alright. Every room has a bathtub. Our sink was clogged though (slow moving water out from the sink). the rest of it is quite alright.   Swimming pool was ok too. No need to book any timings as the COVID rules mostly have been eased.

The hotel sits gently behind the Far East Plaza in Scotts Road and the location is stunning.  Its nestled in a quiet area but is a few minutes walk to Orchard and Scotts Road which makes it appealing. I was also lured by the reviews from previous guests which commented on the clean and spacious rooms and the expectations were not only met, but exceeded.  Our room with two double beds was enormous with a functional desk, a walk in robe and dual vanity in the bathroom.  Importantly the shower was excellent with a powerful shower head and easy temperature control. What also made the stay outstanding was the sheer comfort of the bedsâ¦",10,Jul-22,

I found lots of hairs on top of the bathroom drainage next to the closet.  I was in room 806. Try to avoid this room unless they managed to unclogged the bath tub.  Last but not least there were no towels when I arrived.

York Hotel Singapore,Location is what a guest usually look for in a hotel. Although the price of the room is a little bit high. It is acceptable since it is in a quiet secluded neighbor and yet it is still walking distance from the bustling Orchard Rd. Amenities maybe a l little dated but it is still fine and well maintained. There are no restaurant nor convenience store (distance is around 500m) nearby but the hotel has room service which I did not use. Big rooms that can accomodate 3 people but smaller single beds.,8,Jun-22,

York Hotel Singapore,"The lobby was dazzling, the room.. not so much. Perhaps it was because they placed us in the old wing. The bathroom had a weird, musty smell and the fridge was broken. The quality of the breakfast was pretty great, however, and it was an immense comfort as we were beginning to cease expecting anything exceptional. The service attitude varies, so it depends on your luck as to who attends to your requests. Well, now I know what they can offer, I won't be returning anytime soon.",6,Jun-22,
York Hotel Singapore,It was not worth the price I paid. staff was not flexible in accommodating my needs and took a long time to change the electric kettle when I raised a complaint. Th lobby has few chairs and would have been better if there were more. ,4,Jun-22,
York Hotel Singapore,"The hotel is conveniently located close to the main shopping area of Orchard Road and Scotts Road. So, shopping and food is never a problem. If you are travelling with a big family, Premiere Room is recommended, it sleeps 4 (1 king bed + 2 single bed). Nearby bus stop at Scotts Road connects you anywhere in town. Use Google Map to navigate your way using public transport (MRT and buses). Singapore have a very clean and well-linked public transport system at reasonable price. You may buy your EZ Link card from the nearest Orchard MRT station and you can conveniently use it on all bus and MRT rides in Singapore.",10,Jun-22,

York Hotel Singapore,"I stayed couple of days in this hotel recently. I have stayed in this hotel couple of years before as well.  The hotel is situated in a convenient location. Very close to the Orchard road and easily accessible to public transport etc., yet it is situated in a quiet street next to Mt. Elizabeth Hospital which is very good. The hotel is accessible via Scotts road which is also a major road in the Central Region.  Some of the hotel staff members, the house keeping people, doormen, and restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful. However, the reception area and hotel front officers were not very friendly, and not very keen on helping as well.  Relatively to many hotels in the area, the rooms in the hotel are larger and more spacious.   Buffet breakfast was not very big, but had a decent number of options. Considering the very economical price tag, I think the buffet is good. One thing I noticed about the buffet is that, in my stay, almost every day they had similar dishes, and not much variety among days. Since I was a business traveler and didn't have much time to focus on food, apart from what I ate, I was ok, but for a leisure traveler this may be a problem.  The biggest drawback of this hotel was the cleanliness. I had highlighted this same issue in a review I made few years back, but I can't see an improvement in that sector. The rusty old rooms were the same and I saw fungus in bathroom and surrounding. There were huge mold spots grew around vents, toilet and the sink. It is not expected to see such unclean rooms in an establishment like this in a premier location.  I think the direct booking site can also be improved to give a better user experience.  However, for the low price they charge, in this area,  I think this is a good place to stay, considering the proximity to many important locations.â¦",8,Sep-22,
York Hotel Singapore,The room was nice. We stayed in the cabana. The bed was comfortable. We had a good sleep. Breakfast buffet was decent. The staff were professionals and courteous. They also have a ramp and lift so a plus for having strollers and wheelchair. Overall good and relaxing. Location wise also walking distance from paragon mall.,8,Sep-22,
